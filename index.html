<h1>BOOK SYNOPSIS & REVIEW</H1><br><a href='https://bookdownloadpagehere.blogspot.com/'>Source|Download|Full Content</a><h2>The Tower of Babel</h2><p>Fiction. An established writer from an Eastern college returning to his former San Francisco haunts becomes entangled in a labyrinthine series of events that culminate in the sudden violent death of a respected poet. Described by Lewis Ellingham and Kevin Killian as &#34;a satiric look at the private world of poetry gone public in the wake of the Six Gallery HOWL reading of October, 1955,&#34; THE TOWER OF BABEL includes finely detailed sketches of the San Francisco poetry world and gay life as they existed then.</p><p>It is the late 1950s. John James Ralston, an academic and poet living in Boston, returns to the San Francisco he left seven years ago, a copy of Partisan Review under his arm (it contains a review of his first book). He wants to take risks, to make poetry exciting again. In his first encounter with so-called Beat poets his magazine is torn up and he is presented with a poem in the mouth of a fish; later, one of the poets Ralston has encountered is found dead, apparently from a fall off his fire escape. This unfinished, posthumous potboiler would stand a better chance of finding an audience were it not billed as detective fiction. There is little of the action or tension readers expect from the genre, and the element of amateur detectives seeking clues that will lead them further astray does not enter until late in the book. The writing is flat, and Ralston's repetitive self-analysis (he's also married to a psychiatrist) is hardly insightful. But most disappointing is the unfocused prose. Spicer (1925-1965) was not only a major figure in the San Francisco Renaissance of the late '50s and early '60s, he was one of the most powerful and innovative poets of his time. <br>Copyright 1994 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Young Justice Vol. 1: Gemworld</h2><p><b>Superboy!

From its delta in Vietnam up through Cambodia, Laos, Thailand, Burma and on into China, the Mekong has been a no-go river, its turbulent waters fouled by ideological barriers as formidable as its natural obstacles. But recently the political obstacles have begun to be dismantled river traffic is reviving.John Keay describes the world of the Mekong as it is today, rehabilitating a traumatised geography while recreating the thrilling and historic voyage of Garnier in 1866. The French expedition was intended to investigate the back door into China by outflanking the British and American conduits of commerce at Hong Kong and Shanghai. Two naval gunboats headed upriver into the green unknown, bearing crack troops, naturalists, geologists and artists. The two-year expeditions failures and successes, and the tragedy and acrimony that marked it, make riveting reading.</p><p>John Keay is the author of four acclaimed histories: The Honourable Company, about the East India Company; Last Post, about imperial disengagement in the Far East; Explorers of the Western Himalayas; and India: A History. His other books include India Discovered, Into India and The Great Arc, the story of how India came to be mapped, and Everest named. John Keay is married with four children, lives in Scotland and is co-editor with Julia Keay of the Collins Encyclopaedia of Scotland.</p><h2>Zombies (The Chilling Archives of Horror Comics!)</h2><p><ul> <li>From the banned 1950s horror comics that Dr. Fredric Wertham of the U.S. Senate and mothers didn't want innocent children to devour comes a terrifying and timely anthology of comics of the undead...<i>Zombies</i>.

Staining is visible on the Cover Front &amp; Back. The content of this book is clean. No tears,,Staining is only visible slightly on the edge of the book not on the print.</p><p>"Intrinsically irrational" is how Jon Krakauer characterizes the compulsion to climb Mount Everest in his audiobook <i>Into Thin Air</i>. The highly publicized fates of the May 1996 Everest expeditions, including the tragic loss of 12 lives, seem to bear out Krakauer's statement. Listening to Krakauer read his own account of the events in this unabridged version adds a uniquely intimate and thought-provoking dimension to the tragedy. Although Krakauer reads his account with journalistic professionalism, it's impossible to forget that you are listening to someone unburdening himself of a great weight, an unburdening that sometimes nearly approaches a confession.<p> Since the 1980s, more and more "marginally qualified dreamers" have attempted the ascent of Everest, as guided commercial expeditions have dangled the possibility of reaching the roof of the world in front of anyone wealthy enough to pay for the privilege. In 1996, <i>Outside</i> magazine asked Krakauer, a frequent contributor, to write a piece on the commercialization of Everest, and Krakauer signed on as a member of New Zealander Rob Hall's expedition. The disastrous outcome of the 1996 expedition forced Krakauer to write a very different article. </p><p> Those who read Krakauer's book may wonder whether the audiobook can possibly shed more light on the unfortunate events. It does. Krakauer's chronicle is chilling and horrifying. He recounts with excruciating detail the physical and mental cost of such a climb. Even under the best of circumstances, each step up the ice-clad mountain is monumentally exhausting, and the oxygen-deprived brain loses the ability to make reliable judgements. And on May 10, 1996, when Hall's expedition and several others made their summit assault, the conditions were far from ideal. The mountain was so "crowded" that climbers had to wait their turn near the summit while their bottled oxygen dwindled by the minute. By afternoon a blinding hurricane-force storm had stranded a number of climbers on the highest, most exposed reaches of the mountain.</p><p> By writing and reading <i>Into Thin Air</i>, Krakauer may have hoped to exorcise some of his own demons and lay to rest some of the painful questions that still surround the event. He takes great pains to provide a balanced picture of the people and events he witnessed and gives due credit to the tireless and dedicated Sherpas. He also avoids blasting easy targets such as Sandy Pittman, the wealthy socialite who brought an espresso maker along on the expedition. Krakauer's highly personal inquiry into the catastrophe provides a great deal of insight into what went wrong. But for Krakauer himself, further interviews and investigations only lead him to the conclusion that his perceived failures were directly responsible for a fellow climber's death. Clearly, Krakauer remains haunted by the disaster, and although he relates a number of incidents in which he acted selflessly and even heroically, he seems unable to view those instances objectively. In the end, despite his evenhanded and even generous assessment of others' actions, he reserves a full measure of vitriol for himself.

No one could have a clearer vision of the micro-circuitry of post-modern life&#39; Evening Standard Ostensibly, DeLillo&#39;s blackly comic second novel is about Gary Harkness, a football player and student at Logos College, west Texas. During a season of unprecedented success, Gary becomes increasingly fixated on the threat of nuclear war. Both frightened and fascinated by the prospect, he listens to his team-mates discussing match tactics in much the same terms as generals might contemplate global conflict. But as the terminologies of football and nuclear war the language of end zones become interchanged, the polysemous nature of words emerges, and DeLillo forces us to see beyond the sterile reality of substitution. This clever and playful novel is a timeless and topical study of human beings&#39; obsession with conflict and confrontation. &#39;Powerfully funny, oblique, testy, and playful, tearing along in dazzling cinematic spurts ...A masterful novel&#39; Washington Post</p><p>Don DeLillo's second novel, a sort of <i>Dr. Strangelove</i> meets <i>North Dallas Forty</i>, solidified his place in the American literary landscape in the early 1970s. The story of an angst-ridden, war-obsessed running back for Logos College in West Texas, <i>End Zone</i> is a heady and hilarious conflation of Cold War existentialism and the parodied parallelism of battlefield/sports rhetoric. When not arguing nuclear endgame strategy with his professor, Major Staley, narrator Gary Harkness joins a brilliant and unlikely bunch of overmuscled gladiators on the field and in the dormitory. In characteristic fashion, DeLillo deliberately undermines the football-is-combat clich� by having one of his characters explain: "I reject the notion of football as warfare. Warfare is warfare. We don't need substitutes because we've got the real thing." What remains is an insightful examination of language in an alien, postmodern world, where a football player's ultimate triumph is his need to play the game.Don DeLillo is the acclaimed author of fifteen novels and three plays. He has won the National Book Award, the Jerusalem Prize and the Irish Times International Fiction Prize.</p><h2>Anyone Can Cook (Better Homes &amp; Gardens Cooking)</h2><p>Lacking kitchen confidence?

Altamirano, whose childhood language was Nahuatl, received one of the finest educations available in mid-nineteenth-century Mexico and rose to the highest political and cultural echelons of Mexico. One of the most famous men of his age (along with the Indian president, Benito Ju�rez, who appears in <i>Zarco</i>), Altamirano was a battle-tested soldier, a fiery political militant, and the mentor of the generation of writers who came of age at the turn of the century. <i>Zarco</i> tells the story of an honorable and courageous Indian blacksmith who falls in love with a haughty village girl, only to have her elope with the cold-blooded bandit, &#x201c;Zarco Blue Eyes.&#x201d; Based on major and minor real-life historical characters and incidents, the novel&#x2019;s romantic narrative is accompanied by scenes of stark violence and vigilantism, as private citizens take the law into their hands to pursue and exterminate roaming bands of criminals that are terrorizing rural Mexico. Full of color, drama, and historical detail, <i>Zarco the Blue-eyed Bandit</i> is essential reading for readers interested in Mexican history, banditry, and the Indian question.</p><p>"Nineteenth-century Mexico comes alive in this elegantly crafted melodrama, a bridge to understanding the period's traditional gender roles, its stark moral divides, and, particularly, its harsh racial hierarchies. Ignacio Altamirano was one of several Latin American novelists who escaped the ideological grip of scientific racism long before the region&#x2019;s essayists and scientists could do so. Novelists did not have to disprove prevailing racist notions in order to escape them in fiction. They could create characters who defied racial stereotypes, appealing to their readers to recognize the truth of their depictions despite the pronouncements of prestigious European white supremacists. Not to be missed!"&#x2014;John Charles Chasteen, Patterson distinguished professor of history, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill</p></p><p>Ignacio Manuel Altamirano (1834-1893) was one of 19th-century Mexico&#39;s most important nationalist thinkers and prolific writers. For intellectual and literary historians inside and outside Mexico, Altamirano&#39;s preeminence in 19th-century political and cultural debates have made his prolific writings necessary reading for understanding Mexican liberalism.

Thus began Theosophy, the very first &#34;new age&#34; religion. This thought-provoking and often hilarious study delineates the course of Theosophy and other sects which have come down through the years. Photos.</p><p>Peter Washington is a professor of English and European Literature at Middlesex University.Washington, author and critic for several prestigious British papers, characterizes nineteenth-century America as the land of "spiritual opportunity." Science was challenging the authority of the church while historians were demystifying the Bible and knowledge of non-Christian religions became more widespread. As life became more bewildering, the search for truth and easy answers became more overt and impassioned, and the feats and promises of spiritualists attracted a great deal of attention. But messages from the dead weren't enough, and soon various charismatic individuals created new religions: Mary Baker Eddy and Christian Science, Joseph Smith and the Mormon Church, and Madame Blavatsky and the Theosophical Society. Washington analyzes the rise of nontraditional religions with unfailing acuity, but he also has a great avidity for eccentrics, scoundrels, autocrats, and true believers. This blend of careful analysis and gleeful wit enlivens his anecdote-filled history as it moves on to vividly portray the second generation of self-appointed gurus, including Charles Webster Leadbeater, Krishnamurti, and Gurdjieff. The title? It refers to a stuffed baboon belonging to Blavatsky; it was dressed like a gentleman and held a copy of <i>The Origin of the Species.</i> <i>Donna Seaman</i></p><h2>Falling Under You: A Fixed Trilogy Novella (1001 Dark Nights)</h2><p>Norma Anders has always prided herself on her intelligence and determination.

As one of Wisconsin&#x2019;s most celebrated units, a soldier coming from the battalion was selected to represent the state at the unveiling of the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier in Washington, D.C., in 1921. Today, the 150th is all but forgotten, in part because their unit history was never written. Through letters, diaries, and other recollections, Larson tells us the story of these Guardsmen&#x2019;s experiences.

I have seen enough of it to make me look upon it as the sum of all evils.</p><p>Major General T. J. Jackson, 1862</p><p>In two previous books and numerous articles, I have tried to explain and defend my conclusion that U.S. political leaders from both parties and American citizens generally have misunderstood the motivation of Osama bin Laden, al-Qaeda, and their steadily increasing number of Islamist allies. My argument, simply stated, was and is that Islamist militants are attacking America because of what it does in the Islamic world and not because of the way America's people think, vote, behave, and believe or not believe in God. I readily acknowledge that many of the Islamists confronting us detest our society and lifestyle and would never duplicate them in any country they would govern. Clearly, there would be nothing akin to MTV, gender equality, or quadrennial presidential elections in an al-Qaeda-run Saudi Arabia.</p><p>But granting that reality, I argued that it was a profound and unnecessary mistake, an instance of what Conrad called "human folly," to believe that the Islamist militants' animosities for the accoutrements of our society were the main motivating and unifying factors behind their hatred and willingness to wage war against the United States. Such an error, moreover, would cause U.S. leaders and citizens to grossly underestimate the threat they faced from the Islamists, lead them to deploy insufficient military force, and stand pat on untenable foreign policies, thereby leading to America's defeat. It would be better, I argued, to face the unpleasant reality head on and recognize that the forces led and personified by Osama bin Laden are motivated and united by an ever-deepening hatred for the impact of U.S. foreign policy in the Muslim world. Unqualified support for Israel, a half-century of protecting and nurturing Muslim police states, and a military presence in Muslim lands -- these were the tangible, physical manifestations of U.S. foreign policy that are perceived by most -- yes, definitively, most -- Muslims as a concerted and deliberate attempt to destroy Islam and its followers. This formulation was meant to alert Americans to what I saw as an existential threat to the United States that was in some ways greater than that which had been posed by the Soviet Union. It was more dangerous because it came from an opponent that was far less easy to define, one who, unlike the USSR, had virtues and a thoroughly human and egalitarian theology, and one that was all but impossible to contain and deter.</p><p>My arguments were not meant to be a condemnation of U.S. leaders, policymakers, and their foreign policy as mad, evil, or imperialistic. My goal was simply to suggest that our foreign policies toward the Muslim world had been in place for a very long time, some for more than thirty years, and had run out of gas; that they were not doing the only thing U.S. foreign policies must do: ensure the protection and promote the expansion of liberty and freedom at home, keep America as safe as possible from external attack, and serve as a model of responsible and humane self-government for those abroad who might choose to emulate it.</p><p>More often than not my writings were used by pundits as prime examples of raw America-hating, cowardly appeasement, anachronistic isolationism, and fierce anti-Semitism. Well, so be it. If putting forward a belief that holds U.S. national security interests to be a limited and narrowly defined set of life-and-death issues wins for me such ugly and meant-to-be debate-halting monikers so prized by the U.S. governing elites, I will listen, dismiss them, and press on.</p><p>In deciding to research and write a third book that falls into the category of the United States versus the forces led and inspired by Osama bin Laden, I became increasingly interested in and finally fixed on a single question: "Is the protection of U.S. interests and American citizens, and the maintenance of American sovereignty, independence, and freedom of action, any longer the primary, overriding concern of the U.S. federal government?" The answer should obviously be an emphatic yes, at all times and on every issue. And yet the more I read, researched, and encountered the discrepancy between the words and deeds of U.S. leaders, and especially the vast gulf between their description of the world and the world as I perceived it, the more I became doubtful that the answer to the pivotal question above could be even a timid yes.</p><p>In the obsession with national security that has consumed Americans and their leaders since the 9/11 attacks on New York and Washington, we seem to have fallen into the belief not only that the world changed forever on that date but also that nothing before that date contributed to the events of 9/11 or those that have ensued. In part this is because, as I noted above, we have refused to frankly assess whether the cumulative impact of thirty-plus years of U.S. foreign policies in the Muslim world may have helped to motivate the Islamists who attacked on 9/11 in the name of defending their faith and brethren. In this regard, and to paraphrase the venerable Satchel Paige, our elites seem afraid to look over their shoulders because the truth might be gaining on them. Also contributing to this situation is the fact that most Americans have a difficult time imagining they are anything but good-hearted and benign, or that their impact on the world is anything but generous and uplifting. Cynically, our governing elites use this ingrained predisposition to condemn and defame those who suggest that U.S. policies helped to encourage our enemies on their path to 9/11 and beyond. Our elites, after all, have been the craftsmen, purveyors, and defenders of these policies for three-plus decades, and it is much less dicey in terms of unpleasant domestic political repercussions to savage those critical of their policies by dismissing them as blame-America-firsters.</p><p>Still, even accepting that our national self-esteem and our politi-cal leaders' political fortunes are most easily protected by maintaining the foreign-policy status quo, this did not seem a satisfactory excuse for what my research suggested was a deepening reluctance to make the protection of U.S. interests and citizens the federal government's top priority, and an almost blas� acceptance of war for purposes unconnected to America's national interests. And <i>reluctance</i> is not even the right word to use; it seems rather a combination of shame, embarrassment, and fear of employing American resources to protect Americans. The more I read and reflected on my own two-plus decades of service at the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), the more likely it seemed that the answer to the question, "Does protecting Americans come first?" is very plainly no. The organizing concept of the federal government is no longer, as the Founders intended, the protection and expansion of freedom, liberty, and the rule of law at home, with a foreign policy, backed when necessary by military force, designed to ensure the maintenance of that domestic environment. "The Founding Fathers," the brilliant historian Walter A. McDougall has reminded his fellow citizens, "flatly denied that the United States ought to be in the business of changing the world, lest it only change itself -- for the worse.... [T]hey saw foreign policy as an instrument for the preservation and expansion of American freedom and warned that crusades would belie our ideals, violate our true interests, and sully our freedom." Today, however, the federal government's organizing principle flows directly from the country's pop culture; namely, the federal government, under Republican or Democratic control, does what is easiest, most expedient, least risky, politically correct and opportune, and most sellable. In the present case, these actions are anchored in neither the Founders' intent nor any significant knowledge of American history or the history of the Muslim world.</p><p>In essence, U.S. independence and safety are now threatened by our elites consistently asking the wrong question about national-security policy. Instead of asking what could happen if we do not respond in a timely manner and eliminate a particular threat to the United States -- that is, what will the failure to act cost America in lives and treasure? -- U.S. governing elites ask what will happen if they do act to defend America. The answer to the first question is very substantive and specific. For example, if President Bill Clinton fails to kill Osama bin Laden in the late 1990s, and if President George W. Bush fails to kill Abu Musab al-Zarqawi before March, 2003, both will live to have the chance to execute the deadly actions against the United States they repeatedly promised. Thus, it seems to be only common sense to say that it is better to try to kill bin Laden and al-Zarqawi and fail than not to try at all. The answer to the second question is usually another set of questions from U.S. political leaders and senior bureaucrats that stress the negative political costs that could accrue to U.S. leaders who authorize such actions when the actions subsequently fail to achieve their aim. Using the case of bin Laden, these questions include: "What will the world think of us if we attack and miss? Won't the Europeans view us as hip-shooters? If innocents get killed, won't we alienate Europeans, Muslims, or fill-in-the-blank others around the world?" Summing the answers to such questions usually yields paralysis or an action that is ineffective and that allows -- and sometimes encourages -- those behind the danger at hand to become more confident, bolder, and increasingly lethal.</p><p>I refer here to the bin Laden and al-Zarqawi cases because I am familiar with them on a direct, first-hand basis, but it is easy to see what inaction or ineffective action h...</p></p><h2>Forever in His Arms</h2><p>Against all odds, star-crossed Tennessee lovers Jenny and Tyler fall in love on the eve of the Civil War, forcing Jenny to choose between the life she has known since childhood and the man she loves</p><p></p><h2>Poems That Live Forever</h2><p>Over 175,000 copies have been sold of this perennially popular collection of America&#39;s favorite poems.</p><p></p><h2>The Trail of Blood</h2><p>64 pages. pb.

The tsar&#x2019;s gigantic realm struggled with the advent of modernity and with its own internal contradictions between Asia and Europe, faith and science, different ethnic groups, and the divergent interests of the aristocracy, the middle classes, the urban workers, and the rural poor: a continent of contradictions from abject poverty to fairy-tale wealth captured by authors from Tolstoy to Chekhov, from Gogol to Gorky.<br><br><em>Twilight of the Romanovs</em> opens a door into the world of pre-revolutionary Russia using original photographs taken during the last decades of Romanov rule.

She first examines three perspectives on prosperity: materialistic philosophy, New Age thought, and a transcendent spiritual viewpoint. On the level of the individual, true prosperity means balance, personal satisfaction and fulfilling relationships. Integral to this experience of prosperity is the balancing of polarities: active and receptive, giving and receiving, doing and being. The author, a casual yet careful reader, delivers her material with gentleness, humor and com-passion. The technical quality of the recording is excellent. Creating True Prosperity is certain to be popular among Gawain fans and among listeners interested in a more metaphysical perspective on money. C.S.

The phenomenon is epidemic, with record numbers leaving monthly. Writing in professional partnership with a psychiatrist, Trevor Walters shows that midlife burnout is not caused by stress, as we thought, but by an inner conflict strong and persistent enough to ignite burnout in professional men and women. From decades of counseling burned out clergy and other professionals, the author concludes that in most cases the operative inner conflict is <i>affirmation deficiency</i>. When parents fail in their task of affirming a son&#x2019;s or daughter&#x2019;s unique <i>personhood</i>, the child embarks on a life long quest of seeking after affirmation elsewhere. This is a pursuit they can maintain only so long before burning out around age 50. No book until now has explained External Affirmation Syndrome (EAS), its consequences, and therapy for healing. This will enrich readers and all therapeutic counselors, Christians especially.</p> <p>In this groundbreaking new book, Bishop Trevor Walters draws on his more than three decades as an Anglican priest and marriage and family counselor to show why high-functioning professionals break down in midlife. Contrary to the popular assumption, Walters explains that the primary cause of burnout isn&#x2019;t stress. (Some very high-stress professions have low burnout rates.) Rather, burnout results from an internal conflict. Adults lacking affirmation from parents &#x2013; particularly fathers &#x2013; during the formative years will go about seeking it from those whom they serve &#x2013; an inevitable path to burnout.</p> <p>In collaboration from psychiatrist Jim Stanley, M.D., Walters offers hope by demonstrating that recognizing this hidden source of burnout, far from being a dire diagnosis, is the first necessary step to seeking healing available through the Great Physician, Jesus Christ. Walters looks to the example of the Heavenly Father&#x2019;s relationship with Jesus during his incarnate earthly ministry as a heavenly pattern for relationships. When earthly fathers fall short, real injury is done to their children.

Family secrets come back to haunt Jack Reacher in this electrifying thriller from #1 New York Times bestselling author Lee Child, &#34;a superb craftsman of suspense&#34; (Entertainment Weekly). Jack Reacher has extended his thumb and hit the pavement. His plan is to follow the autumn sun on an epic trip across America, from Maine to California. He doesn&#39;t get far. On a country road in rural New Hampshire, deep in the New England woods, he sees a sign to a place he has never been: The town where his father was born. He thinks, What&#39;s one extra day? and takes the detour. At the same moment, in the same isolated area, a car breaks down. Two young Canadians are trying to drive to New York City to sell a treasure. Now they&#39;re stranded at a lonely motel in the middle of nowhere. The owners almost seem too friendly. It&#39;s a strange place . . . but it&#39;s all there is. The next morning in the city clerk&#39;s office, Reacher asks about the old family home. He&#39;s told no one named Reacher ever lived in town. He knows his father left and never returned. Now Reacher wonders, Was he ever there in the first place? As Reacher explores his father&#39;s life, and strands of different stories begin to merge, he makes a shocking discovery: The present can be tough, but the past can be tense . . . and deadly.</p><p></p><h2>Day Of Deception</h2><p>Argues that there is deception in the federal government, in the home, and in spiritual beliefs, and suggests ways to find the truth</p><p><b>John Hagee</b>, author of the bestsellers <i>Jerusalem Countdown, The Battle for Jerusalem, From Daniel to Doomsday,</i> <i>Life Lessons to Live By,</i> and <i>The Financial Armageddon, </i>is the founder and pastor of the 19,000-member Cornerstone Church in San Antonio, Texas, and president of Global Evangelism Television.Day Of Deception is a hard-hitting and insightful book that exposes the darkness around us. Day Of Deception takes a probling look inside the United States government and exposes blatant acts of deception designed to destroy democracy in America. It exposes the powerful forces trying to annihilate the traditional family, property rights, patriotism, and individualism. Day Of Deception examines the five God-given differences in men and women, which make marriage "as the days of heaven on earth". It also releases the light of truth into the church, exposing doctrines and practices that are deceiving the masses. Day Of Deception calls the reader to discern truth from falsehood in these last days -- and to appropriate the mighty poer of God to emerge victorious. Day Of Deception is an important contribution to pre-apocalyptic literature and a clear warning for Christian awareness in these secular times. -- <i>Midwest Book Review</i></p><h2>Williams-Sonoma Collection: American</h2><p><b><i>AMERICAN</i></b> <br> Filled with simple goodness, classic American food always satisfies.

Onassis, one-time Anatolian refugee, built one of the world&#39;s greatest shipping fortunes; his life defined the jet set. Callas, defiantly Greek yet Manhattan-born, was acclaimed as the Voice of the Century. Almost as famously, she transformed not only opera but herself from dumpy, awkward ingenue to iconic sylph. Together, they shared a love that was passionate, volatile and ill-fated - yet indelible. A day-by-day recreation of the infamous 1959 cruise aboard Onassis&#39;s yacht during which the union was cemented (&#39;It was as if a fire were consuming them both&#39;, remarked Maria&#39;s forsaken husband), and many intimates and family members speaking frankly for the first time, make this the definitive account. &#39;The legend has been spectacularly revived by Gage&#39;s riveting book.&#39; Classic FM - The Magazine &#39;Gage ...tells this tale with a magisterial authority.&#39; Hugh Massingberd, Mail on Sunday</p><p>Nicholas Gage's meticulously documented and consistently absorbing account chronicles the stormy love affair between Maria Callas (1923-77) and Aristotle Onassis (1906-75). Gage sees the soprano who reinvented the art of opera and the tycoon who transformed the shipping industry as kindred spirits, drawn into romance by a deep connection to their Greek origins and a shared sense that, despite all they had achieved, something was missing. They found that absent element in a once-in-a-lifetime passion, which Onassis betrayed by marrying Jacqueline Kennedy in 1968. Gage appears to share the view of the tycoon's Greek coterie, who viewed this marriage as an act of hubris that inevitably led to financial and personal reversals which embittered Onassis in his final years. But he doesn't blame the tycoon for Callas's decline, pointing out that by the time they met, she was already experiencing severe vocal problems and was eager for respite from her taxing performance commitments. In any case, her career and his business dealings take a back seat here to Gage's evocative portrait of his subjects' outsized personalities and the jet-set society in the gaudy postwar years. Some of the new information is revelatory, particularly Gage's persuasive contention that Callas bore Onassis a son who died hours after his birth in 1960. At other times his investigative-journalist approach seems too weighty for this highly personal story of love, rage, and big, big egos. Fortunately, these lapses don't seriously mar a text distinguished by smooth prose, the seamless interweaving of several narrative strands, and a warm sympathy for its genuinely tragic protagonists. <i>--Wendy Smith</i>Widely respected writer and journalist Nicholas Gage has been twice nominated for the Pulitzer Prize, and is producer of several major motion pictures. Author of the international bestsellers Eleni and Eleni&#39;s children (Transworld), Greek by birth and now resident in the US, intimates and family members of both Callas and Onassis have talked to him as never before, many for the first time.</p><h2>Lacross</h2><p>Offers a profile of Monte Lyon, a thirteen-year-old lacrosse player and member of the Onondaga nation, and explores the tradition and importance of the sport in the lives of the Iroquois people today.</p><p>Three generations of lacrosse players are featured in this handsome title that discusses lacrosse as a game, a sport, and an integral part of Iroquois culture. Collaborators Hoyt-Goldsmith and Migdale (Buffalo Days, 1997, etc.) introduce a contemporary young lacrosse player from upstate New York and describe the equipment, playing field, moves, and rules of modern lacrosse. The author also takes readers back to the beginnings of the game, describing the early Iroquois Confederacy, its government and organization, explaining that ``lacrosse was a medicine game played for the well-being of the players, other individuals and the nation. The Iroquois also played in bad times, to cure or prevent disease, or to lift the hearts of the people.'' She provides a history of early lacrosse as a sport in Canada and as an international game, the making of a traditional lacrosse stick, and a new version called box lacrosse. The author conveys her empathy for the Iroquois and the people of the Onondaga Nation, as well as a great deal of information, with an economy of words. The full-color photographs are appealing and well-placed, extending and enhancing the text. (glossary, index) (Picture book/nonfiction. 8-12) -- <i>Copyright �1998, Kirkus Associates, LP. All rights reserved.</i>Grade 4-7AFocusing on 13-year-old Monte Lyons, a member of the Onondaga Nation and third-generation lacrosse player, this photo-essay presents an interesting blend of Iroquois Confederacy history and information about a sport that is growing in popularity. Toggling back and forth between the past and the present, Hoyt-Goldsmith establishes the tradition of this fast-paced game and gives readers a sense of how it has changed and the role it plays in the lives of Monte and his family. Although this is not primarily a how-to book on playing lacrosse, the author does include a diagram of the field, a description of the positions and equipment, and an explanation of the major terms used within play. The process of making handmade lacrosse sticks and a detailed glossary are also included. Vivid, full-color photographs accurately illustrate the game and provide an interesting look at the Onondaga Nation Territory. Only brief mention is made of girls playing the game.

Despite assurances from the Pentagon and allied leaders that everything possible was being done to avoid civilian casualties, Clark determined that the U.S.-led bombardment was a deliberate campaign against Iraqi civilians meant to deprive them of food, water, medical supplies and the wherewithal to resuscitate their economy. Clark argues--unconvincingly--that the U.S. Constitution was grossly violated, that 60% of our troops were duped "people of color" and most of the others were "poor whites," that U.S. warplanes killed 1500 civilians in one Baghdad bomb shelter, and that the American media conspired to persuade the public of the righteousness of the "deeply immoral" conduct of the war by U.S. forces. Saddam Hussein's conduct is not addressed. Illustrations not seen by PW. <br>Copyright 1992 Reed Business Information, Inc.This book by former U.S. Attorney General Clark is unique because it is based on his firsthand experience of the damage inflicted on Iraqi society as a result of the destruction of that country's civilian infrastructure during the Persian Gulf war. Clark goes beyond the usual explanation of the causes and consequences of the war and explains in detail "violations" of international legal principles by the United States and its allies in their war against Iraq. Clark also contends that the U.S. government led Saddam Hussein into taking actions that would justify U.S. military involvement in the Gulf. Clark's arguments may be controversial, especially to readers accustomed to popular explanations about the war, but they are certainly thought-provoking and worth reading.

Osteoporosis is often called "the silent thief" because bone loss occurs without symptoms. Today, 15 million Americans suffer from osteoporosis and, with the increasing proportion of older people in the population, this disease is on the increase. Although osteoporosis commonly affects people over the age of 50, it can strike at any age. </p><p> <b>The Silent Thief</b> is an authoritative book for those with osteoporosis and are concerned with lessening the symptoms, as well as for those who want to prevent the onset of the disease. It fully explains osteoporosis, discusses hereditary and lifestyle factors that contribute to its onset, outlines dietary and supplementary options, and illustrates detailed exercise programs for prevention and treatment at any age. </p><p> <b>Endorsements for <i>The Silent Thief</i></b> </p><p> "To read <i>The Silent Thief</i> is but half of the equation -- put its bone-building exercises into practice, and you'll recognize the full impact and great benefit of its wisdom."<br>- Miriam E.

She has been CTV's fitness expert for on-camera segments and a fitness expert. As a media personality, Karine frequently participates in charity fitness events. </p><p> <b>Frances Budden, MD</b>, is the Director of the Community Osteoporosis Program with Education, St. Joseph's Health Centre. She is on staff at St.Michael's Hospital and Salvation Army Grace Hospital in Toronto. Dr. Budden has written many publications, including several on osteoporosis. </p><p><b>Introduction </b></p> <p> Osteoporosis is the Silent Thief that steals away our bones. It is a degenerative disease that silently weakens bones over time, causing pain, loss of movement, and fractures, and, eventually, seriously affecting quality of life. Osteoporosis is insidious because it frequently goes unnoticed until the sufferer experiences a break or fracture. The disease, in women, often manifests around menopause, and so, with an aging female population the incidence of osteoporosis will rise unless preventative measures are taken. Eighteen million Americans are at risk for osteoporosis and 10 million Americans already have the disease. </p><p> If you are a woman between the ages of 50 and 75 and have been diagnosed with osteoporosis, this book is definitely for you. If you are a man or woman of any age, active or not, who is concerned about bone health, this book is also for you. You can treat osteoporosis if you have been diagnosed with low bone density, or prevent the disease if your bone density is still in the normal range. As with other diseases associated with aging, prevention starts early. Early prevention can help with heart disease, joint stiffness, malnutrition and the symptoms associated with menopause. You can make changes now that will profoundly affect the health of your bones later in life. </p><p><b> How This Book Came About </b></p> <p> As a certified personal trainer and fitness instructor, I have spent years designing programs to help my clients improve their levels of fitness. As the baby boomer population ages, the special needs of my clients have increased exponentially. To the many questions I had been asked over the years about exercise and its effect on osteoporosis, my response was typical: "Do weight training and weight-bearing exercises." It wasn't until I was hired by Dr. Frances Budden that I became interested in the relationship between osteoporosis and the positive effects of exercise on the disease. </p><p> Dr. Budden was not only my client but is also an osteoporosis specialist at St. Joseph's Health Centre in Toronto. It was a collaboration made in heaven: Dr. Budden has a wealth of information about brittle bones and areas susceptible to osteoporosis. I have the physiological and biomechanical background to design exercises to strengthen those very areas. Dr. Budden referred many of her patients to me, and as my client base grew I became increasingly aware of the need for personal instruction and program design in this area. Wouldn't it be great, I thought, if every person with osteoporosis could have a personal trainer come to his or her home to demonstrate the most effective exercises to treat the disease? Wouldn't it be great if people without osteoporosis could learn and practice the exercises that would help prevent them contracting the disease? And so the idea for this book was born. </p><p><b> How This Book Is Different </b></p> <p> Many books about osteoporosis are disease-focused, with minimal practical strategies offered for prevention and treatment. <b>The Silent Thief</b> takes a different approach. An exercise-focused book for the prevention and treatment of osteoporosis, it contains strategies you can implement to outwit the Silent Thief. Many of these strategies appear here thanks to the invaluable contribution of many knowledgeable and experienced trainers and physicians. </p><p> The few osteoporosis books that contain an exercise section focus on non-functional exercises that are outdated. They provide only one exercise for even the most susceptible areas and no progressions. <b>The Silent Thief</b> teaches the importance of progression by providing a number of exercises, of various intensities, to challenge individuals at all levels. It teaches you that you can actually enjoy your fight against osteoporosis. </p><p><b> How This Book Is Organized </b></p> <p> <b>The Silent Thief</b> is organized into three parts: Part A provides an overview of osteoporosis from a medical and preventive perspective; Part B contains diet and drug strategies to prevent and treat osteoporosis; and Part C, will help you use exercise to fight the disease. </p><p> Chapter 1 gives you the medical perspective on osteoporosis, provides a scientific perspective on bone health and lists the causes and risk factors of osteoporosis. </p><p> Chapter 2 focuses on the importance of calcium and Vitamin D in the prevention and treatment of osteoporosis. This chapter explains the roles that these two vital nutrients play in the health of your bones and suggests how to maximize your intake. The information contained here will help you to make dietary and supplemental choices that will mean longer life for your bones. </p><p> Chapter 3 discusses other important nutrients that have a positive impact on bone health: magnesium, vitamin K, potassium, phosphorus and boron. Because soy and soy products contain chemicals that mimic the characteristics of estrogen, they play a vital role in skeletal health. This chapter provides you with the best ways to include these substances in your diet. </p><p> Chapter 4 presents you with drug-based strategies to prevent and treat osteoporosis, and includes a discussion of the risks and benefits of hormone replacement therapy (HRT). </p><p> Chapters 5 to 8 comprise the very heart of the book, as they focus on the positive impact of exercise and functional fitness on bone health. Weight-bearing exercise, resistance training and balance training -- the three most effective ways to strengthen bones and prevent falls -- are investigated in depth in this section. </p><p> <i>Karine Bohme</i> </p><p>-- </p><p> Not long ago I was weak and sore all over. My husband, Jeffrey, couldn't stand the complaining so he gave me a birthday gift. A personal trainer -- Karine! As a result of the exercises she encouraged me to practice, I am no longer sore all over anymore. As a white, 55-year-old, postmenopausal, slight-framed woman, whose mother had a dowager's hump and a fractured hip, I am at high risk for osteoporosis. I learned that exercise and functional fitness are an approach I could take to prevent getting the disease. </p><p> I am an internist and a geriatrician with a special interest in osteoporosis. In 1984, I did postgraduate training with the Bone and Mineral Group at the University of Toronto with Doctors Timothy Murray, Joan Harrison and other great and caring physicians. Most of my time was spent at the Metabolic Bone Clinic at St. Michael's Hospital, where I continue to see patients. I am also the director of the Community Osteoporosis Program with Education at St. Joseph's Health Centre, Toronto. </p><p> I see the greatest devastation caused by osteoporosis caring for my geriatric patients after they have sustained fractured hips, wrists, arms, legs, backs and pelvises. These fractures cause pain, loss of independence, deformity, disability, reduced quality of life, and in about 20 percent of hip fractures, death. In 1984, our ability to diagnose osteoporosis was primitive and the treatment options were limited. But we've come a long way. In 2001, osteoporosis can be prevented, diagnosed and treated! </p><p> The Bone and Joint Decade was officially launched by the United Nations in January 2000 as the decade of global research for preventative and therapeutic initiatives to improve the quality of life for people with osteoporosis, osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis and spinal injuries. This is Karine's and my part toward advancing this initiative. </p><p> <i>Frances Budden, MD, FRCPC</i> </p></p><h2>The Brooklyn Novels: Summer in Williamsburg, Homage to Blenholt, Low Company</h2><p>These three novels of the 1930s constitute an American classic. In their own way, they do for the Jewish immigrants of Brooklyn what Studs Lonigan did for the Irish of Chicago. So it is no surprise that, upon their first publication, Lonigan's creator welcomed them in a review for The Nation, praising Fuchs's keen eye, excellent ear for dialogue, and quick perception of the grotesque, the whimsical, the tragic. "I know of few novelists in America today," James T. Farrell said, "who possess Fuchs's natural talent and energy or his sense of life."<br><br>In his 80s Fuchs wrote: "I used to go on long walks . . . take in the street sights at night. I freely used the sights and happenings in the three novels I wrote in my 20s: Summer in Williamsburg (1934), Homage to Blenholt (1936), and Low Company (1937). . .I had 'ideas' for each of these books, but I soon tired of them, ideas being -- for me, at any rate -- unsatisfactory. I abandoned them. . .and devoted myself simply to the tenement: the life in the hallways, the commotion at the dumbwaiters, the assortment of characters in the building, their strivings and preoccupations, their troubles in the interplay of the sexes. There was always a ferment, slums or no slums. The slums didn't hold them down."<br><br>Time hasn't held down these novels, either. Like Joseph Mitchell's New York sketches of the same period, they are as alive today as the day they were first printed, as tropical-rainforest lush, as exuberant. What's true remains so, and Farrell spoke the truth back in 1937: there are still few novelists in America today who possess Fuchs's talent, his energy, his sense of life.</p><p>Fuchs is a master. He had Pasternak's wonder at youth's encounter with the wider world, and Chekhov's nose for thwarted desire, and Turgenev's generosity to the barbarians of the new order. --Boris Fishman, The New Republic<br><br>There is a touching, reflexive glance backward in much of what Fuchs writes -- a sense of the irretrievable in life. --Art Winslow, Los Angeles Times Book Review<br><br>These novels capture, better than any of the better-known works of the time, the eerie tenor of the Great Depression, the sense of living without a past or any hope for the future. Fuchs' ability to replicate the quixotic energy of life on the streets of New York in this age of futility is unmatched by any of his contemporaries. --Gabriel Miller, The Star Ledger</p><h2>Rainbow Mars</h2><p>Future environmentalist Hanville Svetz travels back in time to retrieve extinct life forms and investigate the mystery of the past inhabitants of the Red Planet</p><p>According to Larry Niven, time travel is logically impossible--sheer fantasy. So when time-agent Svetz heads back from polluted future Earth in search of extinct animals, he tends to sideslip into fantastic, fictional worlds. In short stories collected in <i>The Flight of the Horse</i> (1973), his quests for a horse, a Gila monster, and a whale unearthed a unicorn, a dragon, and Moby-Dick. Less comic but equally daft, <i>Rainbow Mars</i> combines both space and time travel to explore Mars in the deep past, before it was a dead world. Naturally it's populated by a menagerie of warring fictional Martians from Edgar Rice Burroughs (multi-armed sword-wielders), H.G. Wells (tentacles and heat rays), and less familiar authors. Svetz and companions are soon in big trouble. Complications include a gigantic alien tree extending into Mars's orbit--an organic version of the space elevator in Arthur C. Clarke's <i>The Fountains of Paradise</i>. One of these useful "beanstalks" on Earth seems a highly desirable facility, but there are hidden drawbacks, and most of the multiplying timelines lead to disaster. This is fun for experienced SF readers who can follow the in-jokes and the switchback ride through tangled alternative histories. The earlier, even funnier Svetz stories are included as a bonus. <i>--David Langford, Amazon.co.uk</i>Larry Niven is a Nebula Award winner and the author of such classics as <i>Ringworld</i>, <i>The Integral Trees</i>, <i>Tales of Known Space</i>, and <i>Dream Park</i>.

Unfortunately, the first place his search takes him is the bottom of a bottle as he careens from one off-kilter encounter to another in search of himself.</p><p>Jonathan Ames is a columnist, author, screenwriter, raconteur and sometime pugilist who resides in New York City. He is the author of several collections of journalism and novels including I Pass Like Night and Wake Up, Sir! Dean Haspiel is the Eisner award-nominated artist of Billy Dogma, Opposable Thumbs and many more independent comics, including American Splendor.<br><i>From the Trade Paperback edition.</i><b>From Booklist</b><br> With stints as a journalist, novelist, and screenwriter under his belt, Ames tries his hand for the first time at the graphic novel. Beautifully illustrated in moody, expressionist panels by Haspiel, The Alcoholic tells the story of Ames' alter ego, Jonathan A., and his self-destructive love affair with the bottle. Jonathan's taste for liquor begins, as for many with his affliction, during illicit high-school parties. From there, his binges follow their own unique trajectory, keeping pace with an undistinguished college career and following him into an oddly successful livelihood as writer of hard-boiled detective fiction. Ames lends a quirky flavor to Jonathan's occasionally nightmarish narrative by eavesdropping on his relationship with his aging great-aunt; the perplexing estrangement of his best friend, Sal; a heartbreaking romance with a woman he refers to as "San Francisco"; and a drunken midlife tryst with an octogenarian dwarf. Yet Jonathan's tale is ultimately a universal one, reflecting the struggles all of us have in navigating the tributaries of career and relationships while keeping personal demons at bay. --Carl Hays<br><br>Rarely does a collaboration produce a graphic novel of such literary and artistic merit. -- <i>Kirkus Reviews June 16, 2008</i><br><br>THE ALCOHOLIC is gonna be hard to top as my favorite original graphic novel of the year. -- <i> Brian K.

His first book, <i>Shot in the Heart,</i> is a National Book Critics Circle and <i>L.A. Times</i> Book Prize-winning memoir about his older brother Gary, the first man to be executed in Utah after pleading guilty to murder.<b>THE END OF JERRY GARCIA AND THE GRATEFUL DEAD</b><p>He was the unlikeliest of pop stars and the most reticent of cultural icons. Onstage, he wore plain clothes -- usually a sacklike T-shirt and loose jeans, to fit his heavy frame -- and he rarely spoke to the audience that watched his every move. Even his guitar lines -- complex, lovely, rhapsodic but never flashy -- as well as his strained, weatherworn vocal style had a subdued, colloquial quality about them. Offstage, he kept to family and friends, and when he sat to talk with interviewers about his remarkable music, he often did so in sly-witted, self-deprecating ways. "I feel like I'm stumbling along," he said once, "and a lot of people are watching me or stumbling along with me or allowing me to stumble for them." It was as if Jerry Garcia -- who, as the lead guitarist and singer of the Grateful Dead, lived at the center of one of popular culture's most extraordinary epic adventures -- was bemused by the circumstances of his own renown.</p><p>And yet, when he died on August 9, 1995, a week after his fifty-third birthday, at a rehabilitation clinic in Forest Knolls, California, the news of his death set off immense waves of emotional reaction. Politicians, newscasters, poets and artists eulogized the late guitarist throughout the day and night; fans of all ages gathered spontaneously in parks around the nation; and in the streets of San Francisco's Haight-Ashbury -- the neighborhood where the Grateful Dead lived at the height of the hippie epoch -- mourners assembled by the hundreds, singing songs, building makeshift altars, consoling one another and jamming the streets for blocks around. Across town at San Francisco city hall a tie-dyed flag was flown on the middle flagpole.</p><p>Chances are Garcia himself would have been embarrassed, maybe even repelled, by all the commotion. He wasn't much given to mythologizing his own reputation. In some of his closing words in his last interview in <i>Rolling Stone,</i> in 1993, he said: "I'm hoping to leave a clean field -- nothing, not a thing. I'm hoping they burn it all with me.... I'd rather have my immortality here while I'm alive. I don't care if it lasts beyond me at all. I'd just as soon it didn't."</p><p>Jerome John Garcia was born in 1942, in San Francisco's Mission district. His father, a Spanish immigrant named Jose "Joe" Garcia, had been a jazz clarinetist and Dixieland band leader in the 1930s, and he named his new son after his favorite Broadway composer, Jerome Kern. In the spring of 1948, while on a fishing trip, Jerry saw his father swept to his death in a California river. "I never saw him play with his band," Garcia told <i>Rolling Stone</i> in 1991, "but I remember him playing me to sleep at night. I just barely remember the sound of it."</p><p>After his father's death, Garcia spent a few years living with his mother's parents in one of San Francisco's working-class districts. His grandmother had the habit of listening to Nashville's Grand Ole Opry radio broadcasts on Saturday nights, and it was in those hours, Garcia would later say, that he developed his fondness for country music forms -- particularly the deft, blues-inflected mandolin playing and mournful, high-lonesome vocal style of bluegrass's principal founder, Bill Monroe. When Garcia was ten, his mother, Ruth, brought him to live with her at a sailor's hotel and bar that she ran near the city's waterfront. He spent much of his childhood there, listening to the boozy, fanciful stories that the hotel's old tenants told, or sitting alone, reading Disney and horror comics, and poring through science-fiction novels.</p><p>When Garcia was fifteen, his older brother Tiff -- the same brother who, a few years earlier, had accidentally lopped off part of Jerry's right-hand middle finger while the two were chopping wood -- introduced him to early rock &amp; roll and rhythm &amp; blues music. Garcia was quickly drawn to the music's funky rhythms and rough-hewn textures, but what captivated him most was the lead-guitar sounds -- especially the bluesy mellifluence of players like T-Bone Walker and Chuck Berry. It was otherworldly-sounding music, he later said, unlike anything he had heard before. Garcia decided he wanted to learn how to make those same sounds. He went to his mother and proclaimed that he wanted an electric guitar for his upcoming birthday. "Actually," he later said, "she got me an <i>accordion,</i> and I went nuts. <i>Aggghhh, no, no, no!</i> I railed and raved, and she finally turned it in, and I got a pawnshop electric guitar and an amplifier. I was just beside myself with joy."</p><p>During this same period, the Beat scene was in full swing in the Bay Area, and it held great sway at the North Beach arts school where Garcia took some courses and at the city's coffeehouses, where he heard poets like Lawrence Ferlinghetti and Kenneth Rexroth read their venturesome works. "I was a high school kid and a wannabe beatnik!" he said in 1993. "Rock &amp; roll at that time was <i>not</i> respectable. I mean, beatniks didn't like rock &amp; roll.... Rock &amp; roll wasn't cool, but I <i>loved</i> rock &amp; roll. I used to have these fantasies about 'I want rock &amp; roll to be like <i>respectable</i> music.' I wanted it to be like <i>art....</i> I used to try to think of ways to make that work. I wanted to do something that fit in with the art institute, that kind of self-conscious art -- 'art' as opposed to 'popular culture.' Back then, they didn't even talk about popular culture -- I mean, rock &amp; roll was so <i>not legit,</i> you know? It was completely out of the picture. I don't know what they thought it was, like white-trash music or kids' music."</p><p>By the early 1960s, Garcia was living in Palo Alto, hanging out and playing in the folk music clubs around Stanford University. He was also working part-time at Dana Morgan's Music Store, where he met several of the musicians that would eventually dominate the San Francisco music scene. In 1963 Garcia formed a jug band, Mother McCree's Uptown Jug Champions. Its lineup included a young folk guitarist named Bob Weir and a blues aficionado, Ron McKernan, known to his friends as "Pigpen" for his often-unkempt appearance. The group played a mix of blues, country and folk, and Pigpen became the front man, singing Jimmy Reed and Lightnin' Hopkins tunes.</p><p>Then, in February 1964, the Beatles made their historic appearance on <i>The Ed Sullivan Show,</i> and virtually overnight an entire young generation was instilled with a new spirit and sense of differentness. Garcia understood the group's promise after seeing their first film, <i>A Hard Day's Night.</i> For the first time since Elvis Presley -- and the first time for an audience that had largely rejected contemporary rock &amp; roll as seeming too trivial and inconsequential -- pop music could be seen to hold bold, significant and thoroughly exhilarating possibilities that even the ultraserious, socially aware folk scene could not offer. This became even more apparent a year later, when Bob Dylan -- who had been the folk scene's reigning hero -- played an assailing set of his defiant new electric music at the Newport Folk Festival. As a result, the folky purism of Mother McCree's all-acoustic format began to seem rather limited and uninteresting to Garcia and many of the other band members, and before long, the ensemble was transformed into an electric unit, the Warlocks. A couple of the jug band members dropped out, and two new musicians joined: Bill Kreutzmann, who worked at Dana Morgan's Music Store, on drums, and on bass, classically trained musician Phil Lesh, who, like Garcia, had been radicalized by the music of the Beatles and Dylan. "We had big ideas," Garcia told <i>Rolling Stone</i> in 1993. "I mean, as far as we were concerned, we were going to be the next Beatles or something -- we were on a trip, definitely. We had enough of that kind of crazy faith in ourselves.... [The] first time we played in public, we had a huge crowd of people from the local high school, and they went fuckin' nuts! The next time we played, it was packed to the rafters. It was a pizza place. We said, 'Hey, can we play in here on Wednesday night? We won't bother anybody. Just let us set up in the corner.' It was <i>pandemonium,</i> immediately."</p><p>It was around this time that Garcia and some of the group's other members also began an experimentation with drugs that would forever transform the nature of the band's story. This wasn't the first time drugs had been used in music for artistic inspiration or had found their way into an American cultural movement. Many jazz and blues artists (not to mention several country-western players) had been using marijuana and various narcotics to intensify their music making for several decades, and in the 1950s the Beats had extolled marijuana as an assertion of their nonconformism. But the drugs that began cropping up in the youth and music scenes in the mid-1960s were of a much different, more exotic, sort. Veterans Hospital near Stanford University had been the site of government-sanctioned experiments with LSD -- a drug that induced hallucinations in those who ingested it, and that, for many, also inspired something remarkably close to the patterns of religious experience. Among those who had taken the drug at Veterans Hospital were Robert Hunter, a folksinger and poet who would later become Garcia's songwriting partner, and Ken Kesey, author of <i>One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest</i> and <i>Sometimes a Great Notion.</i> Kesey had been working on an idea about group LSD experiments and had staffed a loosely knit gang of artists and rogues, called the Merry Pranksters, dedicated to this adventure. Kesey's crew included a large number of intellectual dropouts like himself and eccentric rebels like Neal Cassady (the inspiration for Dean Moriarty in Jack Kerouac's <i>On the Road)</i> and Carolyn Adams (later known as Mountain Girl, who eventually married Garcia and had two children with him).</p><p>When the Pranksters began holding acid parties at a house in the nearby town of La Honda, California, the Grateful Dead -- as the Warlocks were now called -- became the house band for these collective d...</p></p><h2>Tom Jones</h2><p>An epic romantic comedy tells the coming of age of the orphan Tom Jones, his forbidden love of his rich neighbor, and his adventures in 18th century England.</p><p></p><h2>The Adventures of Tintin, Vol. 1</h2><p>Three classic graphic novels in one deluxe hardcover edition: <i>Tintin in America</i>, <i>Cigars of the Pharaoh</i>, and <i>The Blue Lotus</i>.</p><p>Herg�, one of the most famous Belgians in the world, was a comics writer and artist.

A determined perfectionist with an incredible ego, her beauty, her style, her sense of the outrageous, made her a star. In this candid, illuminating, and detailed biography full of photographs, her only daughter Maria Riva, tells the incredible, fascinating, story of the star's life and career, loves and hates, hits and misses, as only a daughter can.</p><p>Maria Riva was born in Berlin in 1924 and is the only child of Marlene Dietrich. &nbsp;Maria performed in Germany and Italy as part of a USO troupe during World War II and taught acting at Fordham University upon her return to the United States. &nbsp;She has performed on Broadway, radio, television, and film and has been nominated for an Emmy. Maria continues an active life in California and spends time visiting her sons and grandchildren.As Marlene, the German-born Maria Magdalena Dietrich (1901-92) was a charismatic movie actress of the 1930s and 1940s. Like Greta Garbo, Dietrich symbolizes glamour and mystery. There are numerous books about the legend, including the star's own Marlene ( LJ 4/1/89). Riva, Dietrich's daughter, here adds her account. As anticipated, Riva's perspective is unique and affecting. Using her mother's diary, radiograms, and letters, she gives proper weight to Dietrich's youth, her experience on the Berlin stage, her collaboration with director Josef Von Sternberg (e.g., The Blue Angel , 1930; Morocco , 1930), and her latter-day triumphs on stage and as a chanteuse. There are arresting tales here (father and stepfather killed in World War I; a stint entertaining U.S. troops during the Battle of the Bulge; affairs with legends of the screen and other arts) that give the reader a true grasp of both biographer and subject.

Treat yourself to an in-depth education with <i>Vegetables</i>, acclaimed author and teacher James Peterson&#x2019;s comprehensive guide to identifying, selecting, and preparing ninety-five vegetables&#x2014;from amaranth to zucchini&#x2014;along with information on dozens of additional varieties and cultivars.&nbsp; <br> &nbsp;<br> Peterson&#x2019;s classical French training and decades of teaching experience inform his impeccable presentation of every vegetable preparation technique and cooking method. You&#x2019;ll begin by stemming, seeding, peeling, chopping, slicing, dicing, mincing, crushing, and pureeing, then explore less familiar but no-less-useful skills such as turning turnips, charring chile peppers, and frenching French green beans. Once the prepping is complete, Peterson explains the intricacies of the many methods for cooking each vegetable, from the most straightforward boiling, braising, steaming, and stir-frying techniques, to the more elaborate and flavor intense grilling, glazing, roasting, saut�ing, and deep-frying. The text is further enhanced with handsome full-color photography and useful extras, like time-saving workarounds, tips on seasonal purchasing, storage recommendations, and suggestions for kitchen tools you&#x2019;ll really use. <br> &nbsp;<br> Woven in with the fundamentals is Peterson&#x2019;s collection of some 300 recipes that showcase the versatility of vegetables in both familiar and unexpected ways. He offers dozens of refreshing salads; plenty of soups and rich, flavorful stews; crowd-pleasing casseroles and pastas; soul-comforting gratins and risottos; and perfect, hand-crafted gnocchi. There are some surprises, as well. For instance, the hardworking cabbage is pickled, potted, steamed, stir-fried, stuffed, and slawed, but when it appears in the <b>Cabbage Pot�e with Braised Duck Legs</b>, it is transformed into a black-tie entr�e. The <b>Baked</b> <b>Morels Stuffed with Foie Gras</b> is an unapologetically upscale variation on basic stuffed mushrooms, and in his iconic <b>Eggplant Parmesan</b>, Peterson confesses to changing the recipe every time he makes it&#x2014;and urges you to do the same!<br> &nbsp;<br> So the next time you spot some salsify at the farmers&#x2019; market, don&#x2019;t be daunted&#x2014;buy some and give the <b>Artichoke, Morel, and Salisfy Salad</b> a chance. If tender little broccolini show up in your neighborhood grocer&#x2019;s, be sure to try the savory-sweet <b>Broccolini with Pancetta, Anchovies, and Raisins</b>. And when your fifth backyard bumper crop of summer tomatoes has your family longing for take-out after weeks of tomato soup, tomato salads, and tomato sauces, bring them back to the table with <b>Twice-Baked Garlic and Tomato Souffl�s</b>. Whether you&#x2019;re an iconoclastic cook looking to broaden your culinary horizons, or a tradition-minded home chef hoping to polish your prep skills while expanding your repertoire, <i>Vegetables</i> will become your essential go-to reference.</p><p>James Peterson's <i>Vegetables</i> is an encyclopedic yet easy-to-read guide to preparing everything from artichokes and beet greens to plantains and watercress. It contains more than 300 enticing recipes, many which use just three or four ingredients.<p> This is a book about vegetables, but not a vegetarian cook book. To deliver appealingly intense flavors, Peterson uses chicken broth, anchovies, prosciutto, or bacon. He also does not skimp on cream or butter when he feels it is right for a dish.</p><p> Peterson starts with information on buying, storing, and using 64 vegetables. Photos illustrate how to trim fennel, clean and julienne leeks and perform other commonly used techniques. He also provides helpful information along with the recipes, like suggesting that you buy roasted, not raw cashews because they are less likely to be rancid. The recipes range from Mediterranean-style Creamy Zucchini Gratin to Mexican Avocado and Chile "Gazpacho," and Japanese Cucumber Salad, as well as expected classics like mashed potatoes, glazed carrots, and creamed spinach.

How could I sneak out of school that afternoon? Where was I going that weekend? Where was the party? I dreamed of cars, sports, girls; of making money, enjoying life, being a rock star. I saw myself on a boat in the Bahamas and felt the wind in my face, heard the sails flap as we came about, looked up the mast into the white clouds and blue sky. I was there.<br><br>I had eight brothers and sisters, and one Sunday morning my father was driving all of us in the station wagon to Denton Hill, a ski area in Pennsylvania, our gear crammed in the back and on the roof. As everybody vied for attention, I gazed out the window and saw a cabin on the side of a mountain. I pictured myself in that cabin, but in my mind, the cabin was decorated like a Swiss chalet and there was a fire blazing in a big stone fireplace. My skis were on the front porch, ready to go. I wanted to be in the ski patrol, so I pictured my backpack filled with a Swiss Army knife, a first-�aid kit, a walkie-�talkie, and a fold-�up tent. I could smell the pine trees, see the bright white snow, feel the towering evergreens. I don&#x2019;t know where the details came from; I was obsessed with Walt Disney movies, so probably from them or The Sound of Music. I dreamed so often I developed a photographic memory. I saw a scene, clicked it in my mind, and it was there forever. The colors, the feel, the shine, the patina. All right there.<br><br>My father, Richard, a watchmaker and jeweler, was not a man for fantasies. He said I had to learn a trade so I could have dependable work and make some money in this life.<br><br>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s a trade?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You learn to be a mechanic, or work in a machine shop, or be a carpenter.&#x201d;<br><br>I didn&#x2019;t want to be a robot, to wake up in the morning and do the same thing every day. Shop was better than sitting in algebra class, but it wasn&#x2019;t a lot of fun. And I was looking for fun.<br><br>Home was not fun.<br><br>I was born in 1951 and grew up in Elmira, New York, in one half of a side-�by-�side double house at 921 Laurel Street, off Pennsylvania Avenue. My father&#x2019;s family was German Bavarian and Swiss; my mom&#x2019;s came from Ireland and Scotland. My maternal grandmother&#x2019;s maiden name was Burns, and on the Scottish side we&#x2019;re supposed to be related to the poet Robert Burns, but that was never spoken about in our house because Robbie Burns had a reputation as a womanizer and a drinker. The whole family, all eleven of us, ate dinner every night around one big table, and chaos reigned. At any given time there were a couple of babies in high chairs; I would be teasing my sisters, trying to make them laugh; one of my brothers could be flying across the floor; the noise level was high and buzzing. But when my father came home and slammed his fist on the table, everybody went silent. He would be the last to sit down, usually in a foul mood. We were all nervous around him, and in our nervousness we would giggle. Which infuriated him, which made us giggle even more, which made him even madder. Every night we tried to hold it together, and every night we made our father furious.<br><br>When we were alone, we would ask my mother, &#x201c;Why is Dad so angry?&#x201d; My mother, Virginia, a registered nurse who worked the six-�to-�eleven night shift, came home, made breakfast for all of us, and didn&#x2019;t get a lot of sleep, always found the good in everything. A petite woman with chestnut brown hair and one green eye and one brown, she was kind, warm, sensitive, and loving. Mom was a true saint.<br><br>&#x201c;Dad&#x2019;s store is air-�conditioned, and when he comes home it&#x2019;s not air-�conditioned here, sweetheart.&#x201d; That was why he was angry in the summer. &#x201c;The driveway hasn&#x2019;t been shoveled. It&#x2019;s icy, dear.&#x201d; That was why he was angry in the winter. Dad was in a bad mood every season, pretty much all the time.<br><br>My father liked to go out with his buddies. They would play cards, shoot skeet, go to the bar, and bet on sports. He had a life outside the home that excited him&#x2014;he was handsome, impeccably dressed, and loved by everyone who knew him. Around neighbors, customers, and friends, he was perfectly charming. At home he was something else, and no one saw it but us. With a mortgage to pay off and clothes for nine children to provide, home was expensive. He had been raised Protestant and converted to Catholicism when he married my mother, and he followed those rules, but Richard Hilfiger surely did not seem happy with his life, and although with so many children he was a good provider, I doubt he had wanted nine kids. Coming home was facing reality. When his car drove up the driveway each night, we all scattered and hushed.<br><br>If I left my bicycle in the driveway, if my shoes were on the stairs instead of in my room where I was supposed to put them, if I kicked my sister&#x2014;�about once a week from the time I was five until I was eleven, my dad punished and spanked me&#x2014;hard. I hated and feared him, and I never wanted to be in his presence. I became an expert at hiding from my father when he was in the house. I was a phantom, a ghost. I dodged him because I never knew when he was going to find something I had done wrong and go at me.<br><br>My mother was so kind and loving, she didn&#x2019;t like the physical punishment. She knew it was wrong. Her way of trying to protect me was to tell her husband quietly, &#x201c;Enough.&#x201d; She tried to smooth over our relationship, but I was always worried that I would set him off, and every week he proved my fears correct. Whether I was my best self or not, my father scared me every day of my life.<br><br>When there are nine kids in the family, things are complicated. Each of us had a distinct role in the household, but I&#x2019;m not sure there was any rhyme or reason to them. Kathy, the firstborn, was creative and had great taste. She was constantly rearranging the house, a lamp here, a table there, moving the couch to the other wall. She kept everything clean and was every bit the student my father demanded that she be. She was also very aware of the effect of wealth, because we didn&#x2019;t have it. She would point out how other people dressed, where they lived, how they lived: &#x201c;Oh, look, they have a nice car&#x201d;; &#x201c;They have a beautiful home and a swimming pool&#x201d;; &#x201c;Their father is a doctor. They must be rich.&#x201d; My older sister passed that awareness along to me. We would look at the children of business owners, and they would be well dressed and well groomed and living in nice houses, and we&#x2019;d think, &#x201c;They are perfect.&#x201d;<br><br>Kathy tried out for the high school cheerleading squad at a time when cheerleaders were the apex of beauty and was extremely upset when she didn&#x2019;t make the cut. But she was a good gymnast, so they asked her to be the Elmira Free Academy Blue Devil, the mascot. She was very attractive, but she never thought she looked good. She just didn&#x2019;t realize how beautiful she was.<br><br>I was the second child, two years younger, and I couldn&#x2019;t do anything right. I failed miserably in school, and though I tried hard and played with passion, I wasn&#x2019;t an athlete. This pained my father to no end. One of Dad&#x2019;s best buddies was Maury Collins, whose son Charlie was a great athlete. Maury would talk about Charlie and his football all the time. I think it got under my father&#x2019;s skin because he couldn&#x2019;t brag about me. Coaches would tell me, &#x201c;You&#x2019;re too short for basketball&#x201d; or &#x201c;You&#x2019;re not big enough for football,&#x201d; and I didn&#x2019;t like baseball. There was nothing I was good at. Dad would tell me all about the other kids in the neighborhood: &#x201c;Tommy Lynch is brilliant!&#x201d; &#x201c;That Scotty Welliver is a hell of a boy!&#x201d; &#x201c;Jimmy Rogers is a great basketball player!&#x201d; Then he would look at me with disdain. I didn&#x2019;t know what I had done to cross him, but by the time I reached junior high school it was clear to me that there was nothing I could do that would ever make him look at me in a positive way. So I stopped trying.<br><br>My sister Dorothy, born a year after me and named after my father&#x2019;s mother, liked the name Susie, and requested that everyone call her that instead. She&#x2019;s been Susie ever since. Susie was the smart one. Curious, adventurous, and popular, she was anything but a bookworm, yet she amazed everyone with her consistently stellar grades. She had a quick wit, a big crowd of friends, and an answer for everything. My father had a soft spot for her because she was often ill as a child and finally, in her teens, was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis.<br><br>Meanwhile, I was a dreamer. I had to be, because I couldn&#x2019;t understand what everybody else was grasping. English, history, math&#x2014;�I just couldn&#x2019;t follow the texts. When I tried to read a book, I&#x2019;d make it two pages into a chapter and start reading from the bottom up. My eyes would jump from one line to another. I would land in the middle of a page and start reading upward. Sometimes I would start at the right side of the page and read backward&#x2014;�and I could not control it.<br><br>I wanted to learn. I was curious. I guess you could call me nosy, but I was always extremely interested in what was going on around me. And because I couldn&#x2019;t get information the way everyone else did&#x2014;�my dyslexia wasn&#x2019;t diagnosed until much later in life&#x2014;�I picked up on vibes, facial expressions, and body language and developed my own personal radar to carry me through. I faked it.<br><br>I&#x2019;d sit in Mr. Huber&#x2019;s high school math class and think about everything but algebra. It was so confusing to me&#x2014;�2x over y, squares, square roots&#x2014;�and I couldn&#x2019;t help but worry, &#x201c;If I get through this, I have to go do geometry!&#x201d; There was no way I could pay attention; every time I tried, it confused me even more. So I just decided to show up, guess at answers on tests, and see what happened at the end of the year.<br><br>I saw other kids in the class getting it. When Mr. Huber passed out completed exams, I looked at their test papers and saw they got 90s. Mine would be full of red ink and a grade of 35. And while he was going over the answers and the students around me were correcting their mistakes and making notes for next time, I&#x2019;d stare at my teacher&#x2019;s Thom McAn shoes, his brown polyester trousers, his white wash-�and-�wear shirt, his wash-�and-�wear tie, and think, &#x201c;Mr. Huber really must be a good Sears customer!&#x201d;<br><br>Some teachers were sympathetic, because they were nice people and I was a likable kid, kind of a jokester. I had a lot of friends, and we had as much fun as possible without getting thrown out. I was good at imitation, and when a teacher would turn around to write on the blackboard, I was the one who would copy his gestures or mimic his voice to get a laugh, mostly to evade the fact that I was not doing well in school. I knew that they thought that for this boy there was probably not much hope.<br><br>I would sit in class, look toward the blackboard, and not even see it. What was the point? I couldn&#x2019;t read worth a damn. But I could tell you exactly what the teacher was wearing.<br><br>One of my major embarrassments was having to repeat sophomore year. Even worse, I had failed into my kid sister Susie&#x2019;s class; worse still, she was getting 90s, and I was lucky to get 50s.<br><br>Susie also had great taste in clothes. She was conscious of how colors coordinated, and she knew and cared about brands and took care of the contents of her closet and dresser. Susie folded each of her sweaters perfectly, was always precisely aware of what she had&#x2014;�my earliest recollection of inventory control&#x2014;�and guarded her wardrobe zealously; she didn&#x2019;t want any of her sisters touching anything. There was a lot of talk among the girls in my family about clothing and style and what people were favoring. Without them I probably would not have paid a lot of attention, but hearing the chitter-�chatter all the time certainly had an effect. A boy with five sisters knows things other boys don&#x2019;t.<br><br>My sister Elizabeth&#x2014;�Betsy&#x2014;�came along four years after me. She looked like a Hilfiger, but with red hair, blue eyes, and freckles, she was more striking than the rest of us. Not only was she a real beauty, but Betsy was sweet, kind, and caring. She was organized and disciplined, the mirror image of my mother, and became my mother&#x2019;s main helper. When I came home from school and there were fresh cookies or brownies or a cake on the counter, Betsy and Mom had been at it together. Betsy became the Hilfiger historian; anytime anyone wants to know about the family, she&#x2019;s there with the info.<br><br>My brother William Henry was born a year after Betsy. Meticulous even as a little boy, Billy loved to sketch and draw, and he was excellent at math. When we first got jobs, my sisters and I would take the money we&#x2019;d earned and go out and buy something. Billy saved every penny. Sooner or later my sisters and I would outspend our earnings.<br><br>&#x201c;Billy, can I borrow ten dollars?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yeah, but I need it back by Tuesday, or I&#x2019;ll charge interest.&#x201d;<br><br>Two years after Billy, Bobby showed up. A ball of pure energy, he destroyed several cribs&#x2014;�he shook and rocked them apart because he just didn&#x2019;t want to be inside!<br><br>Bobby was always a wiry, frail kid, but when he got to junior high school he started lifting weights and building muscle. By sophomore year he was pretty buff. He was a great natural athlete and a daredevil with no fear at all. Bobby had a funny and sweet nature, and as he grew older he started getting into trouble. We had a motorized minibike, all of us kids&#x2019; favorite mode of transportation, and my father would say, &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t go in the road with it. You&#x2019;re not allowed in the road.&#x201d; Well, Bobby would get on and hit the road. When he&#x2019;d get back and my father tried to raise a hand to him, Bobby would push Dad off or run away. I could never do that.<br><br>Bobby made the football and the wrestling teams. Junior year he was a wrestling star. Senior year he won the New York state championship and earned a junior college scholarship to the State University of New York at Delhi. Bobby was a two-�time National Junior College Athletic Association All-�American wrestler at Delhi and set the record for the most wins at the NJCAA National Wrestling Tournament. He was selected to the Region III 1970s All-�Decade Wrestling Team and earned a place in its Wrestling Hall of Fame. SUNY Delhi named him Athlete of the Year in 1979. He transferred to Appalachian State, in Boone, North Carolina, and won back-�to-�back Division I national championships. My father finally had a son to brag about. I was happy for Bobby and happy that my dad was in a good mood.</p><h2>Incredible Cover Up</h2><p>Exposing the Origins of Rapture Theories.</p><p></p><h2>A Sanskrit Manual for High Schools</h2><p><p>This work has been selected by scholars as being culturally important and is part of the knowledge base of civilization as we know it.</p><p>This work is in the public domain in the United States of America, and possibly other nations.

Even the creation of the Freedmen's Bureau could do little to provide real help. So they learned to make their own opportunities, often in other parts of the country.<br><br>Extraordinary interactive elements bring the lives of these American heroes into chilling focus.

They talked to each other for a few hours or for forty years, and later it seemed to them impossible that they could have missed each other.&#x201d;<br><br>Each chapter of this inventive consideration of American culture evokes an actual meeting between two historical figures. In 1854, Henry James, as a boy, goes with his father to have a daguerreotype made by Mathew Brady and is captured in a moment of self-consciousness about being American. Brady returns to photograph Walt Whitman and, later, at City Point in the midst of the Civil War, Ulysses S. Grant. Meanwhile, Henry James begins a lasting friendship with William Dean Howells, and also meets Sarah Orne Jewett, who in turn is a mentor to Willa Cather. Mark Twain publishes Grant&#x2019;s memoirs; W.E.B. Du Bois and his professor William James visit the young Helen Keller; and Edward Steichen and Alfred Stieglitz argue about photography. Later, Carl Van Vechten and Gertrude Stein, who was also a student of William James&#x2019;s, attend a performance of The Rite of Spring; Hart Crane goes out on the town with Charlie Chaplin; Langston Hughes and Zora Neale Hurston write a play together; Elizabeth Bishop takes Marianne Moore, who was photographed by both Van Vechten and Richard Avedon, to the circus; Avedon and James Baldwin collaborate on a book; John Cage and Marcel Duchamp play chess; and Norman Mailer and Robert Lowell march on the Pentagon in the anti&#x2013;Vietnam War demonstration of 1967. The accumulation of these pairings draws the reader into the mysterious process through which creativity has been sparked and passed on among iconoclastic American writers and artists.<br><br>Ultimately, Rachel Cohen reveals a long chain of friendship, rebellion, and influence stretching from the moment just before the Civil War through a century that had a profound effect on our own time. Drawing on a decade of research, <b>A Chance Meetin</b>g makes its own illuminating contribution to the tradition of which Cohen writes.</p><p>"I can't think of any book that would give more raw pleasure to a book-reading person than <b>A Chance Meeting</b>. Our sense of the continuum of literary community is strengthened and shaded by these stories, which are told with a strange alchemy of grace, restraint, humor and passion." <br>-<b>Dave Eggers</b><br><br>"As original and impressive a work of cultural history as I have encountered in years." -<b>Diane McWhorter</b>, Pulitzer-prize winning author of <b>Carry Me Home<br><br></b>"It can sometimes seem as if all American artists and writers are, and always have been, lone figures who go about their business without any contact with others of their kind. Rachel Cohen has written a lively and fascinating book that turns this idea on its head. Through the captivating device of what the French call 'the magic of the unlikely encounter', she traces a tradition of meeting, sharing, and encouragement among individual writers, painters, and photographers that has enriched American arts and letters in ways that could never have been foreseen. Cohen offers the reader the gift of interconnected portraits, tightly drawn and cleverly told, then stands aside and allows the stories of these encounters -- good as any fiction -- to work their magic. Compelling and delightful." <br>- Thad Carhart, author of <b>The Piano Shop on the Left Bank </b><i><br><br></i>"A wonderful, absorbing book in which information, anecdote, literary understanding and gossip take fire and are transformed into insight.

This is a book worth returning to, immensely distinguished and pleasurable."<br>- Robert Pinsky<br>"How rare to find a book that acts as both intellectual tonic and spiritual inspiration. Even rarer that it's written by a first-time author. The writing is elegant, poetic, and true.

Many in Europe and America saw this as poetic justice on a man they believed had cheated the hangman's noose.<br>Peiper's brilliant reputation as panzer leader of the Fuhrer's Bodyguard Regiment, Die Leibstandarte Adolf Hitler, was tarnished by his previous close association with Himmler and his alleged involvement with the infamous Malmedy Massacre, when unarmed American POWs were shot during the Battle of the Bulge. After a highly controversial war crimes trial, Peiper was sentenced to death but was eventually released from Landsberg prison in 1956.<br>This is the first thoroughly objective account of Peiper's role in the greatest land battle ever fought by the United States of America. Michael Reynolds has spent over twenty years making contact with veterans, including survivors of the Malmedy Massacre, and has accompanied former members of Die Leibstandarte Adolf Hitler, as well as American soldiers, retracing their footsteps in the Ardennes. Through these contacts, and after painstaking research into Peiper's life, he is able to demolish many of the myths surrounding this part of the Battle of the Bulge and to throw new light on the character and career of one of Nazi Germany's most charismatic, if blemished, soldiers.</p><p>Since retiring from a successful military career in 1986, during which he saw active service and was severely wounded, Major General Mike Reynolds has become a highly respected military historian. Married with three daughters and six grandchildren, Michael Reynolds lives in Sussex, England."One of Germany's most daring and charismatic field commanders." -- <i>Publishers Weekly</i><br><br>"One of WWII's most interesting combat leaders . . . a fascinating story of inspired courage, battlefield flexibility and combat leadership." -- <i>Armor</i><br><br>The Devil's Adjutant: Jochen Peiper, Panzer Leader is the story of the ex-aide to Himmler who epitomized the Nazi approach to war, and describes in minute detail the combats fought by the German spearhead in the Battle of the Bulge. As the Americans advanced on the Third Reich in the fall of 1944, they encountered many enemy united of mixed quality. But when the Germans counterattacked, bursting through the U. S. front in December 1944, their offensive was led by Jochen Peiper and the 1st SS Panzer Division - an elite unit hardened in the crucibles of Russia. The Americans faced their greatest challenge in the largest battle of their history. After being sentenced at Dachau for war crimes, Peiper was assassinated by persons unknown, long after the war had ended. The Devil's Adjutant is a fascinating account of modern combat between technologically equivalent adversaries. Michael Reynolds not only depicts the unvarnished reality of battle, but in the process demolishes many myths about Jochen Peiper - one of Nazi Germany's most charismatic, if blemished, commanders. -- <i>Midwest Book Review</i></p><h2>Martin Pippin in the Apple Orchard</h2><p>One morning in April Martin Pippin walked in the meadows near Adversane, and there he saw a young fellow sowing a field with oats broadcast. So pleasant a sight was enough to arrest Martin for an hour, though less important things, such as making his living, could not occupy him for a minute. So he leaned upon the gate, and presently noticed that for every handful he scattered the young man shed as many tears as seeds, and now and then he stopped his sowing altogether, and putting his face between his hands sobbed bitterly. When this had happened three or four times, Martin hailed the youth, who was then fairly close to the gate. &#34;Young master!&#34; said he. &#34;The baker of this crop will want no salt to his baking, and that&#39;s flat.&#34;</p><p></p><h2>Great Ideas the Future of an Illusion (Penguin Great Ideas)</h2><p>This investigation of religion by greatest psychoanalyst of the twentieth-century explores the role faith can take in the life of man, what it can mean to us and why as a species we are inclined towards it.

In the week before the Spring Bank Holiday, nurserymen. garden designers and contractors, television gardeners, celebrities, dignitaries and the royal family all pass through the grounds of the Royal Hospital Chelsea, where dozens of model gardens and hundreds of exhibits of plants have been prepared for their attention. For a week, gardening makes it on to the front pages of the major British newspapers, and the television schedule is filled with daily commentary. The event is, of course, the RHS Chelsea Flower Show. Chelsea is not the world's largest flower show - the RHS Hampton Court Palace Flower Show, which the RHS has been running for the past twenty years, is considerably larger - but it is without doubt the most prestigious. Honoured and emulated around the world, it has been the peak event of the British gardening world for generations, even before the television cameras encroached and it developed an additional audience among those who did not themselves venture through its turnstiles. ..</p> Ranelagh Gardens in 1937 Andy Sturgeon's 2012 Garden for M&amp;G Investments <p><b></b></p> <b>BUILDING THE SHOW GARDENS</b> <p></p> <p>The Society's contract with the Royal Hospital allows contractors to enter the site three weeks before the show. They have a little over a fortnight in which to take the gardens from lawn to finished product. Faith and Geoff Whiten said in their account that when they arrive 'all that is to be seen of our garden are a few wooden pegs banged into the grass'. Then, as work begins in the background on erecting the Great Pavilion, the garden makers get to work. ..At the end of the show, all the building works have to be undone, and all materials removed from the site, within five days. ..</p> <p><b></b></p> <b>OUT AND ABOUT AROUND CHELSEA</b> <p></p> <p>In the late 1020s, two prominent Chelsea residents, the Countess of Lovelace and Jacqueline Hope-Nicholson, started holding tea parties for celebrities and titled guests on the occasion of the show. ..The custom of tea parties continued into the 1970s.</p> <p><b></b></p> <b>RANELAGH GARDENS AT THE ROYAL HOSPITAL</b> <p></p> <p>From the beginning the Chelsea Show used Ranelagh Gardens as a place for visitors to sit, relax, picnic and listen to the bands. ..</p> <p><b></b></p> <b>EMERGING DESIGNERS SINCE 2000</b> <p></p> <p>The twenty-first century has seen the continuation of standard Chelsea themes.

She lives in France.</p>Grade 3-6&#x2013;Creating an art-appreciation book for children that is both substantive and interactive is a challenging undertaking. This title succeeds admirably in certain respects. The die-cut cover arouses curiosity about the guilty facial expressions on Georges de La Tour's card players. The reproductions of masterpieces, which range from the 14th-century illumination of the month of August from <i>The Very Rich Hours of the Duke of Berry</i> by Jean de Limbourg to Marc Chagall's <i>Song of Songs IV</i>, are exceptionally focused and vibrant, and the glossy, cream card stock provides a pleasing background. Each spread includes the painting on the left page and two flaps with details on the right. Underneath the central flap are bulleted directives and questions&#x2013;and some answers. Unfortunately, there is not always a relationship between the queries and the highlighted scenes, so the choices seem arbitrary. A number of the questions are merely quantitative (How many birds are on the tree?) and do not engage higher-level thinking skills. Brief formal and biographical notes are located under the flap and again at the end, adding to the somewhat chaotic arrangement. The second flap reveals four samples from each artist's palette. When a book looks this good, one would hope that the approach would be equally dazzling. Henry Sayre's <i>Cave Paintings to Picasso</i> (Chronicle, 2004) manages to cover interesting formal and contextual considerations with more global examples and a narrative and design that are quite accessible.

With its rich agricultural land, the awareness for&nbsp;sustainable living, and the growing demand for local, organic food, the farm-to-table,&nbsp;locavore movement has become a way of life in the Hudson Valley. <b><i>Organic&nbsp;</i></b>spotlights the Hudson Valley as a region at the forefront of this movement and&nbsp;features the portraits and words of the dedicated farmers who are committed to&nbsp;growing and producing food using sustainable methods, and the chefs who echo their&nbsp;beliefs and pay homage to the food they produce, including such notables as:<br><br>* Amy Hepworth of Hepworth Farms, works on a 7th-generation, family-owned farm<br>* Dan Barber, chef and co-owner of Blue Hill at Stone Barns was named one of the world's&nbsp;most influential people in 2009 in <i>Time</i>'s annual "Time 100"<br>* Zakary Pelaccio, owner of Fish &amp; Game, is famous for building Brooklyn's first gastropub and&nbsp;pioneering NYC's nose-to-tail culinary movement<br>* Ken Greene at the Hudson Valley Seed Library provides many local producers with heirloom&nbsp;and open-pollinated garden seeds and protects 15,000 years of agricultural history!<br>* Steffen Schneider at the 400-acre biodynamic Hawthorne Valley Farm has helped educate over&nbsp;13,000 kids since 1972 as part of the farm's Visiting Students Program&nbsp;<br><br>The over 100 portraits of the farmers and chefs of the Hudson Valley were&nbsp;photographed using the wet-plate collodion process, a technique developed in the&nbsp;1850s when the art of photography was in its infancy.

Americans, says journalist and author Nicholas von Hoffman, are living in a glass dome, a kind of terrarium, cut off from both reality and the outside world. In his words, they are "bobbleheads in Bubbleland...They shop in bubbled malls, they live in gated communities, and they move from place to place breathing their own, private air in the bubble-mobiles known as SUVs."<br><br>We are besieged by technological gadgets, which, while they have succeeded in creating numerous conveniences for our already busy lives, have also managed to fully occupy our attention, distracting us from meaningful discourse about issues of national and international significance. <br><br>America currently spends in excess of $40 billion annually on public education. Yet the numbers are undeniable: in comparing the literacy level of adults in seventeen industrialized countries, America was number ten on the list. And sixteen- to twenty-five-year-olds under-perform their foreign counterparts as well. Moreover, they do so to a greater degree than do Americans over forty.<br><br>The number of Americans who read books has also steadily declined. As a recent National Endowment for the Arts report titled "Reading at Risk" found, many Americans do not ordinarily read voluntarily (that is, matter not required for work or school), and only 57 percent of American adults read a book in 2002.6 When they do read, it is often fiction or books that focus on narcissistic themes such as diet and self-help.<br>Millions of adults are lacking the most rudimentary knowledge about history and world geography, such as the identity of America's enemy in World War II. In fact,<br><br>one reads that 11 percent of young adults can't find the<br>United States on a world map, and that only 13 percent<br>of them can locate Iraq. It turns out that only 12 percent<br>of Americans own a passport, that more than 50<br>percent were (prior to the fall of the Berlin Wall) unaware<br>that Germany had been split into eastern and<br>western sectors in the aftermath of World War II, and<br>that 45 percent believe that space aliens have visited the<br>earth. As in the Middle Ages, when most individuals got<br>their "understanding" of the world from a mass<br>source-i.e., the Church-most Americans get their<br>'understanding' from another mass source: television.<br><br>Television, however, has been a poor teacher. Television news has become a function of entertainment to such an extent that political and historical analysis typically amounts to two- to three-minute sound bites. With such shallow content, it is easy to see why, on the eve of the 2004 presidential election and despite overwhelming evidence to the contrary, 42 percent of Americans believed Saddam Hussein was involved in the September 11 attacks and 32 percent believed he had personally planned them. No wonder the average American's understanding of politics is generally reduced to a few slogans picked up the day before from broadcast news or late-night comedy shows.<br><br>There is truth in the adage that civilizations do not die from being attacked or invaded. They do themselves in. Americans today have come to embody what the renowned eighteenth-century philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche termed "stupidity." Nietzsche was not referring to an intelligent quotient or ignorance, per se; rather, he meant stupidity as in mentally clogged, anesthetized, numb. As author and professor Thomas de Zengotita recognizes: "He thought people at the end of the nineteenth century were suffocating in a vast goo of meaningless stimulation."<br><br>The same could be said of Americans at the dawn of the twenty-first century. We, too, are mentally clogged, anesthetized, numb. Connected to our cell phones, computers, and television sets, we are increasingly disconnected from each other. Even when physically crowded together at concerts and sports spectacles, we fail to truly communicate with one another. According to author Alex Marshall, Americans live "in one of the loneliest societies on the earth."</p><h2>Sixguns and Bullseyes and Automatic Pistol Marksmanship: A Comprehensive Manual on Target Shooting</h2><p>Whether you're a target shooting enthusiast, an experienced shooter, or someone who has never held a gun,&nbsp;<i>Sixguns and Bullseyes and Automatic Pistol Marksmanship</i> will help you explore different types of handguns, fundamental shooting skills, and expert tips to gain marksmanship precision.<br><br>This edition combines two classic shooting manuals from the 1930s in one volume for modern audiences.

He addresses the scope of Modern Art, from its founding days as Abstract Expressionism through its transformations to Pop, Op, Minimal, and Conceptual. <i>The Painted Word </i>is Tom Wolfe "at his most clever, amusing, and irreverent" (<i>San Francisco Chronicle</i>).</p></p><p>In 1975, after having put radical chic and '60s counterculture to the satirical torch, Tom Wolfe turned his attention to the contemporary art world. The patron saint (and resident imp) of New Journalism couldn't have asked for a better subject. Here was a hotbed of pretension, nitwit theorizing, social climbing, and money, money, money--all Wolfe had to do was sharpen his tools and get to work. He did! Much of <i>The Painted Word</i> is a superb burlesque on that modern mating ritual whereby artists get to despise their middle-class audience and accommodate it at the same time. The painter, Wolfe writes, "had to dedicate himself to the quirky god Avant-Garde. He had to keep one devout eye peeled for the new edge on the blade of the wedge of the head on the latest pick thrust of the newest exploratory probe of this fall's avant-garde Breakthrough of the Century.... At the same time he had to keep his other eye cocked to see if anyone in <i>le monde</i> was watching."<p> The other bone Wolfe has to pick is with the proliferation of art <i>theory</i>, particularly the sort purveyed by postwar colossi like Harold Rosenberg, Clement Greenberg, and Leo Steinberg. Decades after the heyday of abstract expressionism, these guys make pretty easy targets. What could be more absurd, after all, than endless Jesuitical disputes about the flatness of the picture plane? So most of them get a highly comical spanking from the author. It's worth pointing out, of course, that Wolfe paints with a broad (as it were) brush. If he's skewering the entire army of artistic pretenders in a single go, there's no room to admit that Jasper Johns or Willem DeKooning <i>might actually have some talent</i>. But as he would no doubt admit, <i>The Painted Word</i> isn't about the history of art. It's about the history of taste and middlebrow acquisition--and nobody has chronicled these two topics as hilariously or accurately as Tom Wolfe. <i>--James Marcus</i></p><b>Tom Wolfe </b>is the author of a dozen books, among them such contemporary classics as <i>The Bonfire of the Vanities, The Right Stuff</i>, and <i>I Am Charlotte Simmons</i>.

In recent years, newspaper headlines have screamed,&nbsp;&#x201c;Scarce water and the death of California farms,&#x201d; &#x201c;The Dust Bowl returns,&#x201d; &#x201c;A &#x2018;megadrought&#x2019; will grip U.S. in the&nbsp;coming decades.&#x201d; Yet similar stories have been appearing for decades and the taps continue to flow. John Fleck argues&nbsp;that the talk of impending doom is not only untrue, but dangerous. When people get scared, they fight for the last drop of&nbsp;water; but when they actually have less, they use less.<br><br> Having covered environmental issues in the West for a quarter century, Fleck would be the last writer to discount the&nbsp;serious problems posed by a dwindling Colorado River. But in that time, Fleck has also seen people in the Colorado River&nbsp;Basin come together, conserve, and share the water that is available. Western communities, whether farmers and city-dwellers or US environmentalists and Mexican water managers, have a promising record of cooperation, a record&nbsp;often obscured by the crisis narrative.<br><br> In this fresh take on western water, Fleck brings to light the true history of collaboration and examines the bonds&nbsp;currently being forged to solve the Basin&#x2019;s most dire threats. Rather than perpetuate the myth &#x201c;Whiskey's for drinkin', water's for fightin' over," Fleck urges readers to embrace a new, more optimistic narrative&#x2014;a future where the Colorado continues to flow.</p><p>A fresh, optimistic narrative that shows how the West has thrived in the face of water scarcity and can handle future shortages.<br><p>John Fleck is director of the University of New Mexico's Water Resources Program.

The&nbsp;dormant gardens glimmered with frost. The skies seemed low enough&nbsp;to touch.&nbsp;<br><br>Aunt Tally, two weeks away from her one- hundredth birthday, called&nbsp;her Gordon setter, Doodles.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;As the young dog joyfully returned to his master, Aunt Tally leaned&nbsp;on her silver- headed cane, the head being in the graceful shape of a&nbsp;hound. Apart from having to use that cane&#x2014;thanks to the usual involuntary&nbsp;dismounts all horsewomen take&#x2014;she betrayed few signs of&nbsp;her advanced years. Had you seen her peering at the ground as she&nbsp;walked along, you would have pegged her at eighty, perhaps.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;&#x201c;More snow coming.&#x201d; She squinted at the sky this March 11,&nbsp;Wednesday.&nbsp;<br><br>Doodles, who had sharper senses, replied, <i>&#x201c;Before sundown.&#x201d;&nbsp;</i>Aunt Tally stroked the dog&#x2019;s head upon hearing the little yodel.&nbsp;Tightening her cashmere scarf, she continued on.&nbsp;<br><br>A deep rumble alerted Doodles, who recognized the motor&#x2019;s signature&nbsp;sound as well as the sound of the tires. Identifying a vehicle by its&nbsp;tire sound and motor is easy for dogs. Humans can&#x2019;t do it.&nbsp;Doodles wagged her tail as she bounded up to the front of the&nbsp;house, where Marilyn &#x201c;Big Mim&#x201d; Sanburne, Tally&#x2019;s niece, had parked&nbsp;her brand-new Dodge half- ton.&nbsp;<br><br>The two walked to the back of the house to join Tally.&nbsp;<br><br>Big Mim, teasingly called &#x201c;The Queen of Crozet,&#x201d; was a formidable&nbsp;woman. However, even Big Mim could be backed off by the small,&nbsp;lean Tally.&nbsp;<br><br>&#x201c;What are you doing out here? It&#x2019;s 24�F.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>&#x201c;Checking for my crocus. A shoot here and a shoot there and I get&nbsp;to thinking about the redbuds.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>Big Mim put one gloved hand on her hip. &#x201c;Redbuds aren&#x2019;t going to&nbsp;be in full flower until about April fifteenth. You know that.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>&#x201c;Of course I do. That doesn&#x2019;t mean I can&#x2019;t check them.&#x201d; She tapped&nbsp;her cane on the old brick. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m longing for spring. By this time of the&nbsp;year I&#x2019;ve had enough.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>&#x201c;You really will have enough if you don&#x2019;t come in out of the cold.&nbsp;You&#x2019;ll catch your death.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s not a baseball,&#x201d; the old woman replied.&nbsp;<br><br>&#x201c;You know what I mean,&#x201d; Big Mim said, sounding tolerant. &#x201c;Are&nbsp;you ready to go, or do you need anything from the house?&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>&#x201c;Just need to put up the dog.&#x201d; Aunt Tally walked to the back door,&nbsp;opened it, and Doodles scooted in, happy for the warmth.&nbsp;<br><br>&#x201c;Purse?&#x201d; Big Mim raised an eyebrow.&nbsp;<br><br>&#x201c;My wallet&#x2019;s in my coat pocket. Purses are a pain. Even if I find one&nbsp;that slings just right over my shoulder, sooner or later it drops down.&nbsp;Hard to carry a purse with a cane.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>&#x201c;Guess it is.&#x201d; Big Mim walked to the passenger side of her blue&nbsp;truck and opened the door for Tally, who climbed in unassisted.&nbsp;Once out on the road, the two chattered as only two people who&nbsp;have known each other all their lives can. Aunt Tally had been pushing&nbsp;thirty when Big Mim was born. It was a day of celebration. Aunt&nbsp;Tally, thanks to a disastrous love affair when young, shied away from&nbsp;marriage but not affairs. She treated Big Mim as her own daughter,&nbsp;which had occasioned some arguments with Tally&#x2019;s late, loved sister.&nbsp;A brother to Big Mim followed later, but he died on the hideous&nbsp;Bataan Death March. Apart from rage and grief, the result was that&nbsp;no Urquhart of any succeeding generation would buy a Japanese car&nbsp;or any product if they could help it. As with all old Virginia families,&nbsp;regard less of generations of marriages on both the male and female&nbsp;sides, they generally referred to themselves by the surname of the first&nbsp;European to settle on Virginia soil. In this case, the Urquharts.&nbsp;<br><br>&#x201c;Speech?&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>Aunt Tally, staring straight ahead, raised her voice a bit. &#x201c;Oh, Mimsy,&nbsp;I make notes. I read them. I throw them out. I can&#x2019;t bear the thought&nbsp;of standing up there spouting bromides and sentimental mush. I&nbsp;haven&#x2019;t found what I want to say.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s a first.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>Aunt Tally ignored this, instead concentrating on an upcoming&nbsp;T-cross. Her farm, Rose Hill, reposed about four miles west of Harry&nbsp;Haristeen&#x2019;s farm. They&#x2019;d passed Harry&#x2019;s place on the way to Crozet,&nbsp;reaching the intersection of a dirt road and the two- lane paved highway&nbsp;on which they traveled.&nbsp;<br><br>&#x201c;Can never drive over this without thinking about Ralston Peavey.&#x201d;&nbsp;Aunt Tally repositioned her cane to her left side. &#x201c;Never found his&nbsp;murderer.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>&#x201c;Someone really wanted him out of this world.&#x201d; Big Mim remembered&nbsp;it, as well. &#x201c;Fall, wasn&#x2019;t it?&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>Aunt Tally nodded in affirmation. &#x201c;A light frost, patchy fog.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>&#x201c;1964. The year sticks in my head because that was the first year&nbsp;Jim was elected mayor.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>Jim Sanburne, her husband, remained mayor, and their daughter,&nbsp;Little Mim, was now vice mayor. The joke was, father and daughter&nbsp;came from two different political parties. Being a small town,&nbsp;Crozet never bothered with term limits. Jim, a good mayor, would&nbsp;most likely retain his office until such day as he died.&nbsp;<br><br>&#x201c;Jim picked up the call from Dinny Myers; wish we had him back.&nbsp;There was a sheriff with sense,&#x201d; Aunt Tally mumbled.&nbsp;<br><br>&#x201c;Oh, the one we have now has sense. You just think everything was&nbsp;better when you were younger.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>&#x201c; &#x2019;Twas.&#x201d; Aunt Tally raised her voice. &#x201c;This country is going to hell&nbsp;in a handbasket. Well, I&#x2019;m not going off on that; it&#x2019;ll ruin my day. But&nbsp;even you have to admit that Ralston Peavey was the best blacksmith&nbsp;you ever saw.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>&#x201c;He was. He was.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>Pleased with her little victory, Aunt Tally recalled the details as they&nbsp;rolled over the spot. &#x201c;Found Ralston right here, spread- eagled in the&nbsp;middle of the road, facedown. Run over one way and then backed&nbsp;over. To make sure he was dead, I reckon.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>&#x201c;Jim saw him before Dinny removed the corpse. Said the tire tracks&nbsp;were clear. They hoped to find the killer from the tire treads. Never&nbsp;happened, of course.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>&#x201c;Dinny and the department really did check every set of tires in the&nbsp;area. He couldn&#x2019;t do all of Albemarle County, but he did check Crozet.&nbsp;Nothing. Not one thing. Some folks thought whoever did it was not&nbsp;from these parts. Not me. I think it was one of us.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>Big Mim slowed for a curve. &#x201c;Well, Ralston could drink. He was&nbsp;pretty loaded.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>&#x201c;He didn&#x2019;t lie down in the middle of the road because he was&nbsp;drunk.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>&#x201c;His truck was by the side of the road.&#x201d; Big Mim, who enjoyed&nbsp;driving her new truck, picked up speed. &#x201c;I still think he&#x2019;d been fooling&nbsp;around, and the husband found out and killed him.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>&#x201c;Maybe, but we all knew who was weak that way. He&#x2019;d never done&nbsp;it before. Two kids&#x2014;what, eight and ten&#x2014;and he seemed to get along&nbsp;with them. I wonder if it wasn&#x2019;t something else. Couldn&#x2019;t be drugs.&nbsp;That hadn&#x2019;t taken off yet.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>&#x201c;Can&#x2019;t imagine Ralston a dealer. Although, being a blacksmith, he&nbsp;had the perfect job for distributing.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>&#x201c;No.&#x201d; Aunt Tally shook her head. &#x201c;Something else.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>Big Mim paused. &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s just say not a stone was left unturned.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>&#x201c;One was, or we&#x2019;d have the killer.&#x201d; Tally frowned.&nbsp;<br><br>&#x201c;After all this time, maybe he&#x2019;s dead himself.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>&#x201c;Mimsy, I&#x2019;ve seen a lot. One of these days, might be 2050, the truth&nbsp;will wriggle out. Always does.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>&#x201c;Talk to Inez?&#x201d; Big Mim mentioned Aunt Tally&#x2019;s best friend, who&nbsp;had graduated from William Woods University&#x2014;then known as&nbsp;William Woods College&#x2014;two years behind Aunt Tally. The lovely&nbsp;school, located in Fulton, Missouri, had provided Aunt Tally with her&nbsp;first taste of life outside Virginia.&nbsp;<br><br>&#x201c;She&#x2019;s flying in two days before, because of the alumnae board&nbsp;meeting.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;&#x201c;Good. Harry&#x2019;s driving.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>Mary Minor &#x201c;Harry&#x201d; Haristeen was not a William Woods graduate.&nbsp;She had graduated from Smith College. Age forty, best described as an&nbsp;attractive tomboy, she now put all her attentions to farming, her true&nbsp;love, as she&#x2019;d quit her job at the post office two years earlier. Harry&nbsp;would be going to the celebration at Aunt Tally&#x2019;s alma mater because&nbsp;she loved the old lady and knew the event was not to be missed,&nbsp;especi ally since the salty woman would give a speech. &#x201c;Be good for&nbsp;Harry to get away,&#x201d; Aunt Tally said.&nbsp;<br><br>At that moment, Harry had her hands full with a William Woods&nbsp;alumna, no less.&nbsp;</p></p><h2>THE SHEEP LOOK UP</h2><p>An enduring classic, this book offers a dramatic and prophetic look at the potential consequences of the escalating destruction of Earth.

His scholarship encompasses the history of the modern age, focusing especially on the political, ideological, intellectual, and military struggles of the twentieth century. Integral to that project has been Lukacs&#39;s effort to clarify and interpret the evolution of thought and consciousness during the approximately 500 years that constitute &#34;modern&#34; history. As the modern age passes, as the institutions, ideas, values, and experiences that composed the life of the era recede and disappear, Lukacs has assumed the responsibility to &#34;think about thinking.&#34; And for Lukacs, no aspect of thought is more important to understanding the modern age than the emergence of historical consciousness. Remembered Past: John Lukacs on History, Historians, and Historical Knowledge: A Reader draws together Lukacs&#39;s scattered and diverse writings on history. The volume serves at once as an introduction to this essential aspect of Lukacs&#39;s thought and an indispensable compendium of his most important writings on the subject. In the essays, reviews, commentaries, and book chapters collected in Remembered Past, Lukacs addresses the problem of historical knowledge, evaluates the contributions of historians and writers who have used, and often abused, history, and examines the significance of place in developing a sense of the past. He concludes with a consideration of the twentieth century and the task of reading, writing, and teaching history. Significantly, this authorized &#34;reader&#34; also includes a complete bibliography of Lukacs?s writings through 2003.</p><p>John Lukacs Was born in Budapest, in 1924, came to the United States in 1946. Until his retirement, he taught history at Chestnut Hill College near Philadelphia. He also held visiting professorships at Columbia, Johns Hopkins, Tufts, and the University of Pennsylvania. A prolific writer, Lukacs's best-known works include The Duel (Yale University Press, 2001), Five Days in London (Yale Nota Bene, 2001), The End of the Twentieth Century and the End of the Modern Age (Ticknor &amp; Fields, 1993), A Thread of Years (Yale University Press, 1999), and Historical Consciousness (Transaction Publishers, 1994)."John Lukacs is an original. His opinions, whether on Winston Churchill, Tom Wolfe, or Alexis de Tocqueville, are stimulating, infuriating, profound, never dull. He is a marvelously agile writer who provides the reader great pleasure while he takes him plumbing for the truth." - Witold Rybczynski, University of Pennsylvania<br><br>"John Lukacs, a premier intellectual and a historian of enviable breadth and depth, is as wise, witty, and penetrating as he is sometimes infuriating. With clarity, grace, and power, he illuminates the course of modern history, while he disposes of the cant, fads, and silliness that mark much of today's historical writing."-Eugene D. Genovese, author, Roll, Jordan, Roll: The World the Slaves Made<br><br>"It was about time that a John Lukacs Reader should be brought out, to show the public the range and depth of this great living historian?s contribution to knowledge, his importance as a thinker and attractiveness as a narrator of events. The editors' generous selection of types of work and subjects warrants changing Reader to Treasury."-Jacques Barzun, author, From Dawn to Decadence: 500 Years of Western Cultural Life, 1500 to the Present<br><br>"Remembered Past is an indispensable volume for the student of John Lukacs's thought ,and more broadly, for any student of history. These collected essays and reviews are as relevant today as they were when first published?indeed, in some cases, even more so. In a field dominated by ideologues who view human beings as simply cogs in the great historical machine, Lukacs restores man to his central place in history and reminds us of the grave moral responsibilities that accompany our free will."-Scott P.

His honors include an Edgar nomination, an O. Henry Award, an NEA Fellowship, and the AWP Creative Nonfiction Award. He lived in St. Louis for thirty years with his wife and three daughters. He currently lives in Worcester, Vermont.Flaky, amiable Jeremy Cook, the linguist Carkeet introduced in Double Negative , leaves the ivied halls of academe for the closer confines of a suburban home in this wrenching yet often exhilarating examination of a troubled modern marriage. When the Wabash Institute in Indiana folds for lack of funding, Jeremy slips into a job in Saint Louis, Mo., with the Pillow Agency, a zany marriage-counseling service. His assignment is to move in with Beth and Dan Wilson and, by observing their interactions, help them decide if their marriage can be saved. Jeremy insinuates himself into the Wilsons' daily activities. His relationship with the couple and their game 10-year-old Robbie is at once intimate and distant, definitely a seat-of-the-pants proposition, but his training as a linguist serves him, and probably the Wilsons, well. Carkeet's premise is fresh, his characters utterly winning and his comic observations full of affection for those caught up in the complex confusions of love. Laugh-out-loud scenes and swift, convincing dialogue mark this lunatic look at serious issues; the conclusion may be irresolute, but all the more believable for that.

A nutritional superstar, it has no cholesterol or saturated fat but plenty of protein, vitamins, and fiber and offers an amazing rainbow of health benefits for vegetarians and non-vegetarians alike.In this groundbreaking new book, Dr. Barry Sears reveals his healthiest Zone diet yet and along the way provides stunning new scientific findings on the disease-fighting and anti-aging benefits of soy. Based on the simple idea that food is your best medicine, <em>The Soy Zone</em> shows you how to maintain peak mental alertness, increase your energy, and reduce the likelihood of chronic disease -- all while losing excess body fat -- by eating delicious soy-based Zone meals.In this eye-opening new book, Dr. Sears drops bombshell after bombshell, including:<ul><li>Why soy is a wonder food</li><li>Why the right soy-based diet can prevent heart disease, cancer, diabetes, depression, osteoporosis, and chronic fatigue</li><li>The serious problems with the traditional grain-based vegetarian diet</li><li>The soy diet secrets of Okinawans, the longest-lived people in the world</li><li>Why a pasta/bread/rice-based diet makes you fat</li><li>Why high-protein fad diets will wreck your metabolism and cause weight gain</li><li>Why the USDA food pyramid is unhealthy</li><li>Why Omega-3 fatty acids must be essential supplements to your diet</li></ul><ul><li>As America is finding out, soy is the most complete and versatile protein source in existence. Now Dr. Sears brings the life-enhancing benefits of the Zone to a mouthwatering collection of delicious soy-based Zone meals, featuring:</li><li>Appetizing new recipes from top chefs, such as Baked Golden Tofu Dumplings, Red Bean Chili, Tempeh Paprikas, Tofu-Eggplant Gumbo, Hong Kong Burger, and Soy Zone-Friendly Vegetarian Pad Thai</li><li>Soy Zone-perfect breakfasts, lunches, appetizers, dinners, and snacks</li><li>The ultimate healthful food plan, with quick and easy fat-burning alternatives to dangerous highcarb diets</li><li>An exercise and longevity plan for men and women</li><li>Helpful recommendations for Soy Zoning your kitchen</li><li>A scientifically proven plan for achieving perfect hormonal balance while losing weight</li></ul><strong>So Enter The Soy Zone Today -- </strong>it may be your greatest investment for a healthy future.</p><p>The world has grown increasingly curious about the benefits of soy in recent years. Not only is it a dietary staple of the people of Okinawa, who live longer than anyone else, it also seems to help prevent heart disease and breast and prostate cancer.<p> So author Barry Sears has now modified his popular Zone diet to include soy and made the whole thing just as easy to follow as before. Fill a third of your dinner plate with a dish high in soy protein and the other two-thirds with fruits and vegetables, and you've got the Zone dialed in.</p><p> Not surprisingly, Sears is just as down on starchy foods--potatoes, pasta, rice, breads, and cereals--in <i>The Soy Zone</i> as he has been in his past books. He says they trigger too large an insulin surge, which leaves people feeling sluggish a couple of hours after the meal, and sends them chasing after another burst of quick energy in the form of other insulin-generating carbohydrates. That, he says, makes people fat. He also comes down on traditional vegetarian diets for that same reason: "The insidious long-term consequence of a grain-based vegetarian diet is the constant elevation of insulin levels," he writes.</p><p> The payoffs of taking this detour into the soy zone are immediate, Sears notes. He promises that people following his diet will think better, feel more energized, look better (he predicts a five-pound weight loss after two weeks on the Zone diet, including about two to three pounds of retained water), and experience fewer sugar cravings. Even better, the addition of 50 daily grams of soy to the diet should reduce total cholesterol levels by about 9 percent, shrinking the risk of heart disease by 20 percent. Add it all up and you get a longer life at a lighter weight--a heck of a promise, but one Sears, as always, is confident the Zone can deliver. <i>--Lou Schuler</i></p><p>Dr. Barry Sears is recognized as one of the world's leading medical researchers on the hormonal effects of food.

G White (2014-05-04)</h2><p>A worldwide, catastrophic flood. It reshaped the face of the planet. It killed millions of animals. It ended the lives of countless men, women, and children. Why would anyone believe a God of love would punish the world like that? You&#x2019;re not alone. Questions like this one have mystified honest, searching people for thousands of years. Skeptics discredit the event as a mere myth, proof that God is nothing more than a cruel tyrant invented by men, while believers struggle to harmonize the love of Jesus and this frightening Old Testament story. There is an answer that actually makes sense that will help you understand the mind of God when it comes to evil, sin, suffering, pain, and punishment.

Marguerite Gavin has found a voice for Kate that captures--without being grating--a voice frazzled and nearly silenced in the violent struggle that caused Kate to leave her job as an investigator for the Anchorage D.A.&#39;s office. This story finds her living in near isolation in her Aleut homeland, where she is asked to once again use her skills as an investigator when a park ranger disappears. In Gavin&#39;s care, the listener can imagine the somewhat eccentric characters. Gavin&#39;s characterization reflects their motivations and personalities as they do little to help Kate unravel this gnarly puzzle. One hopes that this is just the first of the series to be presented on tape. J.E.M.

The Lantern Bearers, also about Roman Britain, won the Carnegie Medal in 1959.Outcast <br> I STORM ON THE COAST THE gale, which had lulled for a little while, came swooping back with a shriek and a beating as of great wings against the village that crouched on the bare hill-shoulder, huddling close to the ground, as though for safety. In the house-place of Cunori, the Chieftain's brother, the hearth-smoke came billowing back in stinging clouds from the smoke-hole in the low turf roof, and the seal-oil lamp hanging from the roof-tree leapt and fluttered and sank, bringing the shadows crowding in, so that for a moment the storm and the things of the storm seemed to have broken through into the small round stronghold of warmth and safety that was Cunori's home. But the gust passed, as the others had done, and the lamp steadied, and the side-driven flames leapt up again on the hearth. Cunori, sitting beside the fire, listened to the gale beating its wild wings all round the house-place, and was glad that the lambing was over and he need not go out again to-night. He leaned forward to catch the light on the spearhead to which he was fitting a new shaft. The old shaft, notched and splintered and warped from many hunts, lay beside him; and the new ashen shaft was satisfyingly white and straight as he fitted it into the socket; and the long, slender head caught the leaping firelight, so that it was like a tongue of flame between his hands. Three hounds lay a-sprawl on the rushes, with their bellies to the warmth: huge, brindled, wolf-seeming creatures. And on the far side of the fire--the Women's Side --Guinear sat spinning. Cunori glanced at her from time to time as he worked, but she never raised her eyes from the whirling spindle with its growing spool of greyish wool. He wished that she wouldlook up; he wished that she would stop spinning for a moment; he wished he could think of something to say that would make her laugh. He liked it when she laughed. That was one of the reasons why he had asked her of her father, two summers ago: so that he could have her laughter by his own fire. But she had not laughed for half a moon now--not since the babe died. Cunori was sorry about the babe, though not so sorry as he would have been if it had been a son. Daughters could be set to help in the field-strips and so on, but almost as soon as they were large enough to be any use you had the trouble of getting them married, and once they were married, you might as well have never had daughters at all--better, indeed, because you had to give some of your own weapons to whoever it was who married them, to seal the bargain. Sons were quite another matter: they went with you on the hunting trail, and they brought their wives home to work on the family field-strips, and when you were too old to hunt, they hunted for you. When you had enough sons, it might be good to have daughters; a daughter before you had any sons at all was really something of a misfortune. But he knew that it did not seem like that to Guinear; all Guinear cared for was that it had been hers, and that it had lived only a day. 'If the harvest is good, I will give her a set of amber pins for her hair,' he thought, laying down the wolf-spear and taking up another that was in need of burnishing. 'And some cooking-pots; and if the harvest is very good, I will give her a length of fine striped cloth such as the merchants sell, to make a tunic.' But he knew that the amber pins and the cooking-pots and even the fine striped cloth would not comfort Guinear for the loss of the babe; and that made him feel helpless, and feeling helpless was a thing that always made him angry; so he scowled at the spear-blade, rubbing harder and harder, as though he hated it. The gale seemed to be rising higher than ever, and under the beating and howling of it a new note was swelling, nowlost beneath the shriller overtones of the storm, now sounding clear: the deep, reverberating boom and crash that was the sea. The wind was going round to the north, piling the seas on to the black rocks of the headland, flinging in wave after wave like the blows of a hammer, as though to batter the cliffs to pulp. He looked up with a start, and even Guinear checked her spinning, as a gust wilder than any that had gone before hurled itself upon the house-place with a drumming that shook the very roof-tree. Luath, the pack leader, opened eyes like twin yellow lamps in the wildly flickering gloom, and growled softly in his throat, then sprang up, followed by the rest, their hair rising along their necks, as the leather apron over the low, shielded entrance was plucked aside, and a figure came ducking in with the eddying gale behind it. Cunori was afoot as swiftly as his hounds, grasping his hunting-spear in one hand while with the other he made the sign to avert evil. But the new-comer was neither live enemy nor storm-driven ghost, though from his appearance he might have been either; and as he came into the leaping flame-light, the great hounds ceased their sing-song snarling and lay down again, and Cunori tossed aside his spear. 'Flann!' he cried disgustedly. 'You were never nearer to a spear between your ribs ! What brings you abroad on such a night?' Flann was gasping for breath as he stood before the entrance, shaking the wild hair out of his eyes. 'The red mare, in the first place,' he panted. She broke out again, and I have been right away over the sea-cliffs after her, and it was so that I saw it. There's a ship caught in the bay and trying to beat out round the headland. She will be on to the Killer Rock by now!' Cunori's disgust was gone on the instant. He remembered the last time a ship had driven on to the Killer. There had been many things washed up by the sea afterwards. He said nothing, but his eyes met Flann's, and a fierce excitement leapt between them. Then, swinging round on the woman,who had risen also, he demanded: 'My cloak! Quick! Bring me my cloak, Guinear.' Flann had already disappeared again, to spread the news throughout the village, as she brought it to him. He caught it from her and flung it round his shoulders, stabbing home the bronze pin, and plunged out after Flann into the buffeting darkness, thrusting back the hounds who made to follow him. The wind almost took his breath away as he made his way down between the crowding huts to the gate of the stockade. Clearly he had not been the first to whom Flann had cried his news, for other dark figures were heading in the same direction, and when they reached it they found the thorn bush which normally blocked the gap at night had already been dragged aside by those who had gone before. They left it so, for those who came after them, and turned seaward, heads down and shoulders hunched, leaning into the wind. The moon, which was near to full, seemed racing across the night, now lost behind great banks of tattered cloud, now sailing out into ragged fjords of clear sky; and as it came and went, the tribesmen were now engulfed in bat-winged darkness, now flooded with swift silver radiance, as they struggled seaward. The whole Men's Side of the village was out and heading for the coast and the promised wreck, streaming out hound-wise across the hills, eager for whatever harvest Camulus the Lord of Storms had sent their way. And among the rest, Cunori came at last over what seemed to be the edge of the world into the full onslaught of the shrieking gale and the salt taste of spindrift on his lips; and crouching against the thrust of the wind that strove to pluck him off and whirl him away like a blown leaf, looked down. From where he stood the cliff fell away in a gigantic tumble of turf-slopes and granite ledges, ending in the jagged thrust of rocks round which the water boiled in yeasty turmoil, whose farthest rock of all, lying hidden beneath the water save at low tide, was the Killer. And out on the Killer, caught and battered and already breaking up, was the ship that Flann had seen. The moon, riding clear of the clouds at that moment, showed her clearly: a mastless, broken-backed thing that had once been a Roman merchantman. The watching tribesmen on the cliff-top had seen many such--transports and galleys, too--plying up and down to the great Legionary Station of Isca Silurium. Sometimes it happened, in a north-easterly wind, that a vessel would get embayed somewhere along the coast and be driven on to the rocks, and when that happened there were seldom any of the crew left to tell the tale; but afterwards their cargoes and their gear came ashore along with their drowned bodies. Cunori held back the hair that whipped across his face, and gazed out towards the wreck, wondering how long she would hold together. Not long, he thought, not long in this sea; and he spared a moment to think that it would not be good to be in that ship now, before he plunged on down the narrow, swerving cliff-track to the sea. Half-way down he all but fell over a squatting figure, and realized that it was Merddyn the Druid, Merddyn the old and crazy, who had once been powerful. The old man was crouching in the shelter of an outcropping rock, crooning to himself and swaying to and fro as he watched the scene below him. He looked up as Cunori halted an instant beside him, and laughed, with a high, inhuman, seabird note in his laughter. See there!' he cried above the wind. 'See down there! A fine sight--a sight to warm the hands at as though it were a fire! Aiee! That was a great wave! Right over them! Another as great, and there will be one ship's crew the fewer of the Eagle People, to strut in the sun! One more wave. Oh, wave and king among waves, great white-maned, stallion-crested wave, come swiftly and trample with your hooves and make an end, that the old heart of Merddyn the Druid may rejoice!' Cunori left him and went on down the steep track, crouching against the wind. Below him the great waves thundered in, pounding upon the rocks, pounding upon the doomed ship; but indeed it was no ship now, only a pitiful broken thing thatgrew smaller with every wave. On a level patch a little above the foot of the cliff the tribesmen were gathering. From here a man might almost have hurled a spear into the wreck; but the moon was dimming into the clouds again, and through the flung spray and turmoil of the storm they could see no sign of any life on board, nor hear any cry. There was nothing that the tribesmen could do to help, and even if there had been, they would scarcely have thought to try. To take from the sea was unlucky. If any man got ashore living, that was another matter; they would give him food and shelter, tend his hurts, and send him on his way. But from this wreck, in this sea, no man would get ashore living. Rhythmically, remorselessly, the great waves came in, hurling against the rocks and breaking with a booming thunder that made the solid ground shudder under Cunori's feet. He was drenched with spray, dazed and stunned by the sheer stupendous tumult of wind and sea. The dimmed moon was brightening again, and by its light he saw, through the curtain of flying spume, the dark shape of the wreck; and even as he looked, a huge curled and crested wave reared up, arching over it: the great wave that Merddyn had called for. It broke with a crash that seemed to shake earth and sky, plunging and pouring down. Black reef and black wreck were engulfed in it, hidden in a boiling turmoil from which the spray burst upward in a spreading sheet and was whipped away by the wind. And when it cleared, the white water was sluicing down the crannies of the reef, boiling over the hidden Killer; and of the wreck there was no sign. Even as the tribesmen watched, a great, silver-fringed cloud swept across the moon, and the world was quenched in darkness. &nbsp; <br> &nbsp; <br> The gale, as though it had accomplished its purpose, began to abate from that moment, and it was in a spent grey dawn that the tribesmen went searching among the rocks along the Seal Strand a little back from the headland for the things that the storm had brought them. A high grey sky, veined with blue and silver, arched above a gale-swept world, and the dying wind had gone round, so that in the lee of the cliffs it was almost still. But the great combers came rolling in in white unbroken ranks to crash and cream among the rocks and on the little shingle beaches. The tide was out, leaving the narrow beaches littered with the things that had come ashore already from the wreck: spars and timber and cordage that would all come in useful; a few carcasses of sheep; wineskins that came rolling in, and were gathered by men who made human chains and waded out to meet them; drowned seamen who must presently be given burial, lest their wet ghosts come dripping to the hearths of the village. With the next two tides there would be more, more of everything, all along the bay. No more after that. Cunori, searching under the headland, with a mass of dripping cordage under one arm, was the first to find two bodies among the rocks. Most of those they had found so far had been seamen, but these were of a different kind. They were a man and a woman, held close in each other's arms with a clasp so strong that not even the rocks had been able to break it. They were both young. The man looked as though he were a soldier--a look which Cunori, himself a warrior, recognized: maybe a soldier going to join his Legion. The woman's long, wet hair, outflung across the rock, and trailing among the grey and olive sea-wrack, was golden brown. Lovely it must have been when it was dry, Cunori thought. He bent to look at the two more closely, and as he did so, something stirred between them. With a startled exclamation, he drew back; then stooped closer, to investigate. He found a wonder; one thing that had come alive out of that raging sea. Tightly lashed with what looked like strips torn from a cloak, into the hollow of the man's shoulder, was a very young baby. It was the rocks, Cunori thought, rather than the sea, that had killed its mother and father, and their bodies had shielded the babe. Now it stirred, making a tiny, sick, crowing sound as it tried to breathe. It was blue, andhalf drowned: quite soon, if it were left to itself, it would be dead, too. And for a moment Cunori hesitated. It would be much less trouble to leave it there. Then, hardly knowing why, he took his hunting-knife from his belt and cut the strips of cloth that held it to its father, and lifted it clear. It was a man child, not more than four or five moons old, and it was quite unhurt. 'I must get the water out of this thing, or it will die,' Cunori thought, and he held it upside down and shook it. A little salt water came out of its mouth, and he went on shaking it. Suddenly it began to wail: a thin, bleating cry like that of a new-born lamb, but desperately weak. Cunori turned it right end up and looked at it in wonder, feeling the tiny life of it fluttering and fighting for existence between his hands; then with a hurried and almost shame-faced gesture bundled it into the folds of his wet cloak and stowed it in the crook of his arm against what little warmth there was in his own chilled body. Food, he thought; he must get it to food and warmth quickly, or that fighting spark of life in it would go out. He cast one last uncertain look at the man and the woman. He did not think that they could have had any thought of saving the babe--not in such a sea and such a coast: they must have meant only that the three of them should be together. But they <i>had</i> saved the babe; and Cunori wanted it. He wanted it for Guinear, because it might comfort her better than amber pins or a new cooking-pot could do. Holding it close against him, he turned to go. He found himself face to face with Merddyn the Druid, and checked, startled. It was never pleasant to find Merddyn close to one unexpectedly; his eyes were yellow, cold and bright and hard as jewe...</p><h2>The Social Animal (A Series of Books in Psychology)</h2><p>Winner of the American Psychological Association&#39;s National Media Award, this book is an introduction to modern social psychology.

Bruch and Ghoshal provide simple strategies for bolstering individual willpower and action-taking abilities, and explore ways to marshal the willpower of others to encourage collective action.</p><p><strong>Heike Bruch</strong>is a Professor of Leadership at the University of St. Gallen (Switzerland).<p><strong>Sumantra Ghoshal</strong>is Professor of Strategic and International Management at London Business School and co-author of Managing Across Borders (HBS Press, 1998).</p>"By its very nature, a manager&#x2019;s job leaves little room for reflection," Bruch and Ghoshal contend, "and as a result managers tend to ignore or postpone dealing with the organization&#x2019;s most crucial issues." How can managers overcome this problem and learn to take "purposeful action" rather than drowning in the day-to-day deluge of email, phone calls and meetings? That&#x2019;s the question the authors answer in this practical and motivating, if somewhat academic, self-help business book. Focusing on the productive minority, Bruch, a professor of leadership at the University of St. Gallen (Switzerland), and Ghoshal, a professor of strategic and international management at London Business School, conducted a 10-year study to learn how effective managers overcome the "traps" of overwhelming demands, unbearable constraints and unexplored choices. Their findings were numerous, but above all, they highlight the importance of willpower: productive managers want to produce, and they make an internal, emotional investment toward getting the job done. Along with a plethora of case studies and charts, the authors provide a six-step program for helping managers imbed such will and commitment within themselves. Just as importantly, they provide guidance on how organizations can rearrange themselves to accommodate and foster such willful leaders, since "to exercise their willpower, managers must first have sufficient freedom to act." An excellent choice for managers struggling with days of "mindless busyness," this book teaches its readers how to identify their goals and reach them.<br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Kalman--brilliant creator of Max the millionaire poet dog in <i>Ooh-la-la (Max in Love)</i>--not only reflects the vibrant nature of the busy hub, she paints comical portraits of the folks behind the scenes who make it all happen: ("Etha delivers the mail--a letter to Mr. Pickle <i>cannot</i> go to Mr. Schnikle.") We're also introduced to the people who "zip and zap and whiz" through Grand Central as passengers: ("The woman with the blue pancake hat is going to Chinatown to buy Poo Nik Tea.") Snapshots of "things you'll see" in the terminal include someone waiting patiently, someone waiting impatiently, and someone looking up. Things you won't see? Einstein sailing and the pyramids of Giza. <i>Next Stop Grand Central</i> is a compassionate, quirky view of a cross-section of humanity--and that, Kalman seems to be saying, is what Grand Central Station is all about.

Here are the great tycoons of American industry - Andrew Carnegie, John D. Rockefeller, Andrew Mellon, J. Paul Getty - and the grande dames who took such pains to launch their children on the sea of society. Here are the luxurious vacation places of America's aristocracy - Newport, Palm Beach, Bar Harbor - and the sports that filled the idle hours: golf, polo, lawn tennis, skiing. Cotillions at the Copley Plaza, coming out parties in Charleston, charity balls on Nob Hill, bachelor blasts at the "21" Club - all these and more fill these lively pages with glances at a style of American life that has persisted for the last century and a half.</p><p></p><h2>Stitching a Revolution - The Making of an Activist</h2><p><blockquote><p>From the frontlines of one of the greatest human struggles of our time comes this powerful and moving tale. Both an important cultural history of the AIDS crisis and an intimate personal memoir, Stitching a Revolution is the story of a man who, besieged by discrimination, death, and despair, found the courage and strength of spirit to conceive and create a unique healing vision-the AIDS Memorial Quilt.</p></blockquote><p>Against the turbulent backdrop of politics and sexual liberation in San Francisco during the seventies, Jones recounts his coming-of-age alongside friend and mentor Harvey Milk--and, later, Milk's assassination and the ensuing riots that threatened to tear down all they had accomplished. But Jones's political aspirations were put on hold after the emergence of an insidious, unexplainable "gay cancer" that would soon become known throughout the world as AIDS. Demoralized by the tide of death and despair sweeping his community, brutally assaulted by gay-bashing thugs, and faced with the specter of his own positive diagnosis, Jones sought a way to restore hope to a world falling apart beneath his feet.</p><p>What started out as a simple panel of fabric stitched for his best friend now covers a space larger than twenty-five football fields and contains over eighty thousand names. The Quilt has affected the lives of many people, bridging racial, sexual, and religious barriers to unite millions in the fight against AIDS.</p><p><em>Stitching a Revolution</em> is a compelling, dramatic tale with a cast of memorable characters from all walks of life. At times uplifting, at times heartwrenching, this inspiring story reveals what it means to be human and how the power of love conquers all--even death.</p></p><p>There can be few American stories more inspiring than that of the tremendous 43,000-panel AIDS quilt, a national memorial as powerfully symbolic as the Vietnam War Memorial--but made from a material as fragile and ephemeral as human life. The quilt is predicated on a simple concept: putting names to those who have died of AIDS humanizes the statistics and forces those who visit the quilt to look beyond the stigmatized categories of gayness and contagious disease that cling to the popular image of AIDS. Cleve Jones stitched the first panel in his backyard in February 1987 as a memorial to his best friend, Marvin. He has been speaking in public about the quilt for many years now, and his narrative in <i>Stitching a Revolution</i> is smooth and engaging. Perhaps his best quality as a storyteller is his generous recognition of others, shown in his memory of Rosa Parks in her Sunday hat: "When she handed me the quilts she'd made for her neighbors," Jones recalls, "she wanted to relish only their lives, not the divisions--just memorialize her friends and what they'd meant to her. You're doing a wonderful thing, young man, she'd said. There were no tears in her eyes, just a message for me to continue. Did my fatigue show? Did she see that the death threats and potshots had taken their toll? Dismiss them, she seemed to say, and grow old. A challenge. I brighten and feel combative." <i>--Regina Marler</i>Cleve Jones, founder of the NAMES Project Foundation, has been at the forefront of the AIDS movement since 1981.

The stunning debut of a lively new culinary voice, <em>The Cook and the Gardener</em> chronicles a year in the life of the walled kitchen garden at Chateau du Fey and its taciturn, resourceful, charmingly sly peasant caretaker. Using the fruits and vegetables harvested from Monsieur Milbert's garden, Amanda Hesser creates four seasons of recipes tied ineluctably to the land and the all-but-forgotten practices upheld by Milbert. Hesser's sublimely simple recipes&#x2015;each with accessible ingredients and clear notes and instructions&#x2015;also tell a story. They are a month-by-month record of the ingredients available to her, so that this cookbook also serves as an almanac for cooks. Special "Basics" sections at the opening of each season lay the culinary groundwork for the recipes that follow. Tips on how to buy, store, and prepare particular vegetables, fruits, and herbs are presented in margin notes to recipes. By bringing the kitchen closer to the garden, <em>The Cook and the Gardener</em> gives home cooks a new understanding of the produce they have on hand, whether from the supermarket, the farmer's market, or their own gardens. At the same time, it captures the quirky customs and wily wisdom of a vanishing way of life in provincial France.</p><p><i>The Cook and the Gardener</i> is Amanda Hesser's first book. From the opening lines of its introduction, her literary gifts are as evident as her passion for good food. Since this work combines recipes with her essays about Monsieur Milbert (the gardener at the Chateau du Fey in Burgundy, where Hesser worked as the cook), readers get to enjoy both of her talents. <p> Hesser worked hard to get M. Milbert to talk with her. She shares the careful, deliberate way she wooed him, sometimes by bringing freshly baked bread to his less mobile wife, sometimes by holding back questions she wanted to ask, just to win his tolerance of her presence. Crusty, surly, and tradition-bound, he is the quintessential French peasant. Fortunately, Hesser--who is respectful and patient even when M. Milbert's stubborn ways exasperated her--knows he is an almost-vanished breed. None of his children, or anyone else, is likely to work as he has, continuing to live mainly off the land for nearly 60 years.</p><p> Each chapter covers a month, starting with March, when the nearly 400-year-old walled garden comes to life. Hesser talks about the garden, how she used the bounty gathered by M. Milbert, and muses on life in and around Burgundy. In September, "the rains seemed to clean off and illuminate the plants' colors ... everything seemed to wake up, as after a hot, cranky nap." The final tomatoes are harvested, as are the green and butter beans, with Milbert sneakily keeping the best for himself. Hesser visits a neighbor's Portuguese-style garden, as exuberant and vivid as Milbert's is restrained and disciplined. She cooks saut�ed red snapper with tomatoes, fennel, and vermouth; makes a profound Tomato Consomm�; and slow roasts tomatoes into meltingly tender mounds.</p><p> Sepia drawings by Kate Gridley add to the low-key charm of this information-packed work. (It even includes a history of purslane going back to the Middle Ages.)</p><p> The knowledge and maturity of this work belie Hesser's youth. Not yet 30 at the time of writing, she's a wise cook worth following. <i>--Dana Jacobi</i></p>Amanda Hesser, co-founder and CEO of Food52, is the author of the award-winning The Essential New York Times Cookbook, Cooking for Mr. Latte, and The Cook and the Gardener, as well as the editor of the essay collection Eat, Memory.

Brooks&#39; book The Mute Christian Under the Smarting Rod discusses his own experience in dealing with temptation and human weakness.</p><p>Brooks, Thomas (1608-1680). &#34;Nonconformist preacher. Born into a Puritan family, he was sent to Emmanuel College, Cambridge. He soon became an advocate of the Congregational way and served as a chaplain in the Civil War. In 1648 he accepted the rectory of St. Margaret&#39;s, New Fish Street, London, but only after making his Congregational principles clear to the vestry. On several occasions he preached before Parliament. He was ejected in 1660 and remained in London as a Nonconformist preacher. Government spies reported that he preached at Tower Wharf and in Moorfields. During the Great Plague and Great Fire he worked in London, and in 1672 was granted a license to preach in Lime Street. He wrote over a dozen books, most of which are devotional in character. He was buried in Bunhill Fields.&#34;</p><h2>I Love Lucy: Celebrating 50 Years of Love and Laughter</h2><p>It broke boundaries, set standards, and generally taught Hollywood how to make a sitcom during television's infancy. Today <i>I Love Lucy</i> continues to draw new generations of fans. This book, a success in hardcover and now available in paperback with a complete redesign, is jam-packed with rare photos, fan letters, inspiring celebrity tales, fun facts, and is a complete, chronological guide to each and every beloved episode of America's all-time favorite sitcom.<p>Whether Lucy is hawking Vitameatavegamin, stuffing chocolates in her mouth, or doing some 'splainin to Ricky for her kooky adventures, she made us literally laugh 'til it hurt, ensuring that the world will always love Lucy.</p></p><p><b>Elisabeth Edwards</b> has worked with the Arnaz family since 1992 and has written numerous Lucy&#x201d; books to date for Running Press: <i>The I Love Lucy Guide to Life</i>, <i>I Love Lucy 50th Anniversary Edition</i>, <i>The Lucy &amp; Desi Scrapbook</i>, <i>The I Love Lucy Scrapbook</i>, and <i>I Love Lucy: Best Friends</i>. She lives in Connecticut with her family.In January 1953, 70% of American households tuned their televisions to watch the birth of Little Ricky (and the arrival of big Ricky to the hospital in a voodoo headdress). Then in its second season, I Love Lucy was the first program to feature a genuinely pregnant star (though the writers couldn't use the word; instead Lucy was "expecting"). While this episode, along with the chocolate factory fiasco, remain among the most adored, it's also worth recalling that Orson Welles appeared during the fifth season as a magician. I Love Lucy was a seminal reflection of 1950s America that, though noted for its wacky heroine, brought some serious issues into our living rooms: household divisions of labor, immigrant visibility, gender roles, and the realities of a pregnant belly. In this revised edition of The Official Episode Guide, photos accompany summaries of every episode, capturing both the humor and the innovation. Fans who need more than a pair of Lucy and Ethel salt-and-pepper shakers to sate their obsession will appreciate the pictures, trivia, and quotes that tell the story of this seminal show. Illus.

Kennedy offers an introduction to one of the liveliest and most popular fields in philosophy - time and space - aimed specifically at a beginning readership with no background in philosophy or science. He goes to the philosophical heart of the issues without recourse to jargon, mathematics, or logical formulas and introduces Einstein&#39;s revolutionary ideas in a clear and simple way, as well as concepts and arguments of other relevant philosophers, both ancient and modern. Current debates in philosophy and physics are also handled with exemplary clarity and Kennedy is able to provide readers with a real sense of where we have come from and where we are going. The writing is engaging, lively, and entertaining and serves to introduce the subject to beginning students as well as providing a clear statement of the &#34;state of the debate&#34; for a popular science readership. Kennedy covers such topics as Einstein&#39;s special and general relativity, how to build an atom bomb, the four-dimensional universe, the possibility of time travel, the impossibility of motion, whether space curves, the big bang, black holes, and the idea of inflationary and accelerating universes.</p><p>J.

A good text for an introductory course on the philosophy of relativity, or background reading for a more advanced course.&#34; - International Journal of Philosophical Studies &#34;A very clear and enjoyable book. A real strength is the way it relates issues about space and time that physicists have grappled with, over the history of science, to deep and longstanding philosophical issues. Introductory books sometimes make passing reference to the deep philosophical questions, but I&#39;ve never read one that introduces them so clearly, and then uses them so effectively, to enliven and illuminate the issues.&#34; - Carl Hoefer, Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona</p><h2>Depraved Indifference</h2><p>Karp investigates a terrorist hijacking that results in the death of a member of the NYPD bomb squad and learns of powerful groups protecting the terrorists--with ties to the Catholic church, the FBI, and Israeli Intelligence</p><p><p><strong>Robert K.

He was imprisoned by the powerful mistresses of the great estates--women who, over time, fell in love with him. After 18 years of living in their gilded cage, Kelric finally made his escape.<br><br>In <i>Ascendant Sun</i>, Kelric returns to Skolian space, only to find the Empire in control of the Allied forces of Earth. With little more than the clothes on his back, Kelric is forced to take work on a merchant vessel. But when that vessel enters Euban space, Kelric finds his worst nightmare realized: he becomes a slave to the cruel Aristos--humans who use torture and sex as the ultimate aphrodesiac.<br></p><p>The adventures of super-sexy space-stud Kelric Garlin continue, as he comes back from the dead in <i>Ascendant Sun</i>, the fifth--and so far raciest--installment in Catherine Asaro's popular <i>Saga of the Skolian Empire</i> series (which kicked off with 1995's <i>Primary Inversion</i>). But Kelric needs to keep his miraculous resurrection hush-hush: presumed dead after crash-landing on Coba 18 years ago in <i>Last Hawk</i>, love-prisoner Kelric endured and finally escaped the lusty attentions of the planet's swoony ruling matriarchy. Back at last, the bronze-god telepath finds that his world has been turned upside down: The galaxy-uniting psiberweb has collapsed, the Allied Worlds of Earth control the Skolian Empire, and his family, the Ruby Dynasty, are all either dead or held hostage, leaving him as the sole and long-lost Imperial Heir, a man nearly everyone in power would see imprisoned or assassinated--if they knew he was alive. <p> Harvard-trained physicist Asaro continues to astound by straddling the SF and romance genres so adroitly, alternating between chin-rubbing speculations on quantum theory and blushingly steamy sex scenes with all the skill of an accomplished ballet dancer (which, coincidentally, she also is). Surely junior-high kids will get their paws on this title <i>tout de suite</i> (and quickly skip to the "good" parts), but Asaro's award-winning prose, her knack for high-adventure story-telling, and her equal expertise in both science and romance make this a worthy read for any fan of either genre. <i>--Paul Hughes</i></p>Ascendant Sun is an ambitious novel that showcases Catherine Asaro&#39;s ability to raise thoughtful questions about gender roles while weaving an exciting web of romantic adventure and hard science fiction.</p><h2>Two Days after Forever: A Reader on the Choreography of Time (Sternberg Press)</h2><p><p>Published on the occasion of the Cyprus Pavilion at the 56th Venice Biennale, <i>Two Days after Forever</i> is not an exhibition catalogue, but rather an alternate temporal manifestation of the themes of the pavilion itself&#x2015;in 2015, realized by artist Christodoulos Panayiotou and curated by Omar Kholeif.

Dolan, Catholics have struggled to reconcile two sets of values, as Americans and as Catholics. In this incisive, elegantly written account, Dolan explores how Catholics have met the challenges they have faced as New World followers of an Old World faith. <br> The ideals of democracy--and American culture in general--have deeply shaped Catholicism in the United States, Dolan argues, even as far back as 1789, when the nation's first bishop was <em>elected</em> by the clergy (and the pope accepted their choice). Dolan follows the tension between American democratic values and Catholic doctrine, from the conservative reaction after the fall of Napoleon, to the modernist movement of the late nineteenth century, to the impact of the Second Vatican Council. Dolan explores grassroots devotional life; the struggle against successive waves of nativism, from nineteenth-century Know-Nothings to the Ku Klux Klan of the 1920s; the impact--and often, collision--of different immigrant groups and their traditions; and the disputed issue of gender. He shows throughout that influences have flowed in both directions; belief and church traditions have shaped Catholics' sense of citizenship, community, and public advocacy.<br> Today, the author writes, the tensions remain, as we see signs of both a resurgent traditionalism in the church in response to the liberalizing trend launched by John XXIII, and a resistance to the conservatism of John Paul II. In this lucidly written account, the unfinished story of Catholicism in America emerges clearly and compellingly, illuminating the inner life of the church and of the nation.</p><p><br><strong>Jay P. Dolan</strong> is Professor Emeritus of History at the University of Notre Dame. He has authored or edited several books on the history of American Catholicism, including his best known work, <em>The American Catholic Experience: A History from Colonial Times to the Present</em>.

Put simply, he argues that America has been quite good for Catholicism and that Catholicism must continue to adapt to American culture if it is to endure, let alone flourish."--<em>Christian Century</em><p></p><br>"This absorbing inquiry answers the often troubling question of what it means to be both a Catholic and an American."--<em>Booklist</em><p></p><br>"A brilliant study about the relationship between Catholicism and American democratic ideals, this timely book considers the historical foundations and subsequent evolutions of Catholicism's adaptation to and influence on American self-understanding. This well-documented, and lucidly written book is essential reading for all Americans interested in religion and politics. Wholeheartedly recommended."--<em>Library Journal</em><p></p><br>"An eminent Catholic historian examines the ways American culture and Catholicism have affected one another. In his most engaging section, covering the past 40 years, he reveals his great admiration for John XXIII and his disdain for the conservative, authoritarian policies of the current pontiff. He does a good job, as well, of showing how Hispanic and black Catholics have affected the church as a whole."--<em>Kirkus Reviews</em><p></p><br>"The product of a lifetime's learning and passion, Jay Dolan's new work offers a compelling interpretation of the varieties of American Catholicism and of the tense and conflicted but ultimately creative encounter of the church of migrants and immigrants with the challenges and opportunities of American democracy."--Robert Orsi, author of <em>The Madonna of 115th Street: Faith and Community in Italian Harlem, 1880-1950</em><p></p><br>"In this limpid, sometimes aching book, the historian Jay Dolan explores the American Catholic dilemma so frequently imposed from outside as well as inside: can Catholics be Americans without compromise? Dolan offers an extraordinarily mature, subtle, and sophisticated account that integrates American and Catholic history with an eye for irony as well as understanding--a simply wonderful book from the master historian of Catholicism in America."--Jon Butler, author of <em>Awash in a Sea of Faith: Christianizing the American People</em><p></p><br>"Few American historians have acquired the broadness of mind and intellectual curiosity to do what Jay Dolan has done in this book. <em>In Search of an American Catholicism</em> represents a tour de force of mature scholarship, careful but critical thought, and engaging prose. The work represents a bold departure from earlier social histories of American Catholicism to engage relevant theological and intellectual issues without ever losing sight of their social context. At a time when the Roman Catholic Church is re-examining its role and mission in American society, this book could not come at a more auspicious time. This book deserves the widest possible attention from readers within and without the Catholic tradition. All will learn more about Catholicism. All will learn more about America."--Harry S.

In 1955 she went to Cambridge University on a Fulbright scholarship, where she met and later married Ted Hughes. She published one collection of poems in her lifetime, <i>The</i> <i>Colossus</i> (1960), and a novel, <i>The Bell Jar</i> (1963).

Somewhere between the second and third volumes of Jan Karon's Mitford Years series, dyed-in-the-wool bachelor Father Timothy Kavanagh and his next-door neighbor Cynthia Coppersmith tied the knot. The author left it to readers' imaginations to fill in the blanks. In this delightful story, Karon paints a complete picture of the events surrounding the wedding of Mitford's best-loved couple, and chronicles the poignant and often hilarious reactions to the nuptial news by the tightly knit North Carolina community.<p> All the details cherished by those who are enchanted by weddings are offered here, from the color of the bridal outfit (aquamarine) to the choice of flowers (virgin's bower and hydrangeas). When the wedding bells finally ring, the pews are packed with the people who make Mitford special: ornery Uncle Billy, delightful Miss Sadie, indispensable Louella, and the cantankerous Emma Newland. And there's not a dry eye in the house when Father Tim's problematic foster child Dooley Barlowe sings for the two people who love him the most.</p><p> <i>A Common Life</i> is not just a wedding story. It's also an intimate portrait of the unfolding love between Cynthia and the shy Father Tim, complete with fears and hesitations, professions of commitment, and Barnabas the dog delivering love letters. But there's nothing heavy-handed here. The tensions don't run any higher than wondering if Cynthia will make it to the wedding on time after getting locked inside her own bathroom, or guessing if Esther will make her famous three-layer orange marmalade cake for the reception. Told in the warm, down-home style that Karon has built her reputation on, <i>A Common Life</i> is sweet without being saccharine, charming without being cloying. It's an invitation to a literary reunion of the best kind, and like all weddings, it will probably coax a few tears and plenty of smiles. <i>--Cindy Crosby</i></p><b>Jan Karon</b>, who lives in Blowing Rock, North Carolina, was an award-winning advertising executive before following her dream of writing books.&nbsp;&nbsp;She is the author of five Mitford novels.&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>At Home in Mitford</i> and <i>Out of Canaan</i> appeared on the <i>New York Times</i> and other bestseller lists.&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>At Home in Mitford</i> was named am ABBY Honor Book by the American Booksellers Association in 1996, 1997, and 1998.<br><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i></p><h2>The Well-Tempered Clavier: Part I</h2><p>THE WELL-TEMPERED CLAVIER - REVISED EDITION PART I, BWV 846-869 Series: Henle Music Folios Publisher: Henle Urtext Edition Medium: Softcover Editor: Ernst-G�nter Heinemann Composer: Johann Sebastian Bach The world-famous pianist Andr�s Schiff, a most familiar name to Bach fans on account of his complete recordings of Bach&#39;s piano works, has provided fingerings for both parts of the Well-Tempered Clavier.

It was a three-story pink stucco building between Ninety-first Street and Ninety-first Place, just about a mile outside of Watts proper. Twelve units. All occupied for that month. I had just gathered the dirt into a neat pile when I heard Mofass drive up in his new '53 Pontiac. I knew it was him because there was something wrong with the transmission, you could hear its high singing from a block away. I heard his door slam and his loud hello to Mrs. Trajillo, who always sat at her window on the first floor?best burglar alarm you could have.<br><br>I knew that Mofass collected the late rent on the second Thursday of the month; that's why I chose that particular Thursday to clean. I had money and the law on my mind, and Mofass was the only man I knew who might be able to set me straight.<br><br>I wasn't the only one to hear the Pontiac.<br><br>The doorknob to Apartment J jiggled and the door came open showing Poinsettia Jackson's sallow, sorry face.<br><br>She was a tall young woman with yellowish eyes and thick, slack lips.<br><br>"Hi, Easy," she drawled in the saddest high voice. She was a natural tenor but she screwed her voice higher to make me feel sorry for her.<br><br>All I felt was sick. The open door let the stink of incense from her prayer altar flow out across my newly swept hall.<br><br>"Poinsettia," I replied, then I turned quickly away as if my sweeping might escape if I didn't move to catch it.<br><br>"I heard Mofass down there," she said. "You hear him?"<br><br>"I just been workin'. That's all."<br><br>She opened the door and draped her emaciated body against the jamb. The nightcoat was stretched taut across her chest. Even though Poinsettia had gotten terribly thin after her accident, she still had a large frame.<br><br>"I gotta talk to him, Easy. You know I been so sick that I cain't even walk down there. Maybe you could go on down an tell'im that I need t'talk."<br><br>"He collectin' the late rent, Poinsettia. If you ain't paid him all you gotta do is wait. He'll be up here soon enough to talk to you."<br><br>"But I don't have it," she cried.<br><br>"You better tell'im that," I said. It didn't mean anything, I just wanted to say the last word and get down to work on the second floor.<br><br>"Could you talk to him, Easy? Couldn't you tell'im how sick I am?"<br><br>"He know how sick you are, Poinsettia. All he gotta do is look at you and he could tell that. But you know Mofass is business. He wants that rent."<br><br>"But maybe you could tell him about me, Easy."<br><br>She smiled at me. It was the kind of smile that once made men want to go out of their way. But Poinsettia's fine skin had slackened and she smelled like an old woman, even with the incense and perfume. Instead of wanting to help her I just wanted to get away.<br><br>"Sure, I'll ask 'im. But you know he don't work for me," I lied. "It's the other way around."<br><br>"Go on down there now, Easy," she begged. "Go ask 'im to let me slide a month or two."<br><br>She hadn't paid a penny in four months already, but it wouldn't have been smart for me to say that to her.<br><br>"Lemme talk to 'im later, Poinsettia. He'd just get mad if I stopped him on the steps."<br><br>"Go to 'im now, Easy. I hear him coming." She pulled at her robe with frantic fingers.<br><br>I could hear him too. Three loud knocks on a door, probably unit B, and then, in his deep voice, "Rent!"<br><br>"I'll go on down," I said to Poinsettia's ashen toes.<br><br>I pushed the dirt into my long-handled dustpan and made my way down to the second floor, sweeping off each stair as I went. I had just started gathering the dirt into a pile when Mofass came struggling up the stairs.<br><br>He'd lean forward to grab the railing, then pull himself up the stairs, hugging and wheezing like an old bulldog.<br><br>Mofass looked like an old bulldog too; a bulldog in a three-piece brown suit. He was fat but powerfully built, with low sloping shoulders and thick arms. He always had a cigar in his mouth or between his broad fingers. His color was dark brown but bright, as if a powerful lamp shone just below his skin.<br><br>"Mr. Rawlins," Mofass said to me. He made sure to be respectful when talking to anyone. Even if I actually had been his cleanup man he would have called me mister.<br><br>"Mofass," I said back. That was the only name he let anyone call him. "I need to discuss something with you after I finish here. Maybe we could go somewhere and have some lunch."<br><br>"Suits me," he said, clamping down on his cigar.<br><br>He grabbed the rail to the third floor and began to pull himself up there.<br><br>I went back to my work and worry.<br><br>Each floor of the Magnolia Street building had a short hallway with two apartments on either side. At the far end was a large window that let in the morning sun. That's why I fell in love with the place. The morning sun shone in, warming up the cold concrete floors and brightening the first part of your day. Sometimes I'd go there even when there was no work to be done. Mrs. Trajillo would stop me at the front door and ask, "Something wrong with the plumbing, Mr. Rawlins?" And I'd tell her that Mofass had me checking on the roof or that Lily Brown had seen a mouse a few weeks back and I was checking the traps. It was always best if I said something about a rodent or bugs, because Mrs. Trajillo was a sensitive woman who couldn't stand the idea of anything crawling down around the level of her feet.<br><br>Then I'd go upstairs and stand in the window, looking down into the street. Sometimes I'd stand there for an hour and more, watching the cars and clouds making their ways. There was a peaceful feeling about the streets of Los Angeles in those days.<br><br>Everybody on the second floor had a job, so I could sit around the halls all morning and nobody would bother me.<br><br>But that was all over. Just one letter from the government had ended my good life.<br><br>Everybody thought I was the handyman and that Mofass collected the rent for some white lady downtown. I owned three buildings, the Magnolia Street place being the largest, and a small house on 116th Street. All I had to do was the maintenance work, which I liked because whenever you hired somebody to work for you they always took too long and charged too much. And when I wasn't doing that I could do my little private job.<br><br>On top of real estate I was in the business of favors. I'd do something for somebody, like find a missing husband or figure out who's been breaking into so-and-so's store, and then maybe they could do me a good turn one day. It was a real country way of doing business. At that time almost everybody in my neighborhood had come from the country around southern Texas and Louisiana.<br><br>People would come to me if they had serious trouble but couldn't go to the police. Maybe somebody stole their money or their illegally registered car. Maybe they worried about their daughter's company or a wayward son. I settled disputes that would have otherwise come to bloodshed. I had a reputation for fairness and the strength of my convictions among the poor. Ninety-nine out of a hundred black folk were poor back then, so my reputation went quite a way.<br><br>I wasn't on anybody's payroll, and even though the rent was never steady, I still had enough money for food and liquor.<br><br>"What you mean, not today?" Mofass's deep voice echoed down the stairs. After that came the strained cries of Poinsettia.<br><br>"Cryin' ain't gonna pay the rent, Miss Jackson."<br><br>"I ain't got it! You know I ain't got it an' you know why too!"<br><br>"I know you ain't got it, that's why I'm here. This ain't my reg'lar collectin' day, ya know. I come to tell you folks that don't pay up, the gravy train is busted."<br><br>"I can't pay ya, Mofass. I ain't got it and I'm sick."<br><br>"Lissen here." His voice dropped a little. "This is my job. My money comes from the rent I collect fo' Mrs. Davenport. You see, I bring her a stack'a money from her buildin's and then she counts it. And when she finishes countin' she takes out my little piece. Now when I bring her more money I get more, and when I bring in less..."<br><br>Mofass didn't finish, because Poinsettia started crying.<br><br>"Let me loose!" Mofass shouted. "Let go, girl!"<br><br>"But you promised!" Poinsettia cried. "You promised!"<br><br>"I ain't promised nuthin'! Let go now!"<br><br>A few moments later I could hear him coming down the stairs.<br><br>"I be back on Saturday, and if you ain't got the money then you better be gone!" he shouted.<br><br>"You can go to hell!" Poinsettia cried in a strong tenor voice. "You shitty-assed bastard! I'ma call Willie on yo' black ass. He know all about you! Willie chew yo' shitty ass off!"<br><br>Mofass came down the stair holding on to the rail. He was walking slowly amid the curses and screams. I wondered if he even heard them.<br><br>"bastard!!" shouted Poinsettia.<br><br>"Are you ready to leave, Mr. Rawlins?" he asked me.<br><br>"I got the first floor yet."<br><br>"Mothahfuckin' bastard!"<br><br>"I'll be out in the car then. Take your time." Mofass waved his cigar in the air, leaving a peaceful trail of blue smoke.<br><br>When the front door on the first floor closed, Poinsettia stopped shouting and slammed her own door. Everything was quiet again. The sun was still warming the concrete floor and everything was as beautiful as always.<br><br>But it wasn't going to last long. Soon Poinsettia would be in the street and I'd have the morning sun in my jail cell.<br><br>Copyright � 2002 by Walter Mosley</p><h2>Hour Game (King &amp; Maxwell Series, 2)</h2><p>PB as shown see my photos.

Sean King was momentarily distracted when a presidential candidate he'd been guarding was assassinated a few feet from where he stood, and Michelle Maxwell left the Service under a similar cloud when she lost a "protectee" to an ingenious kidnapping scheme, events told in Baldacci's typical terse, fast-paced style in <i>Split Second</i>. Now partners in a private investigation firm in a small Virginia town, they're hired to investigate a burglary at the home of a wealthy local family. But even before the chief suspect in the break-in meets his death in a gruesome slaying reminiscent of a serial killer long since caught and punished, King and Maxwell get caught up in a string of other murders, each of which copies the techniques of another madman, from San Francisco's Zodiac Killer to Chicago's infamous John Wayne Gacy. While the two protagonists aren't especially complex or well-developed, the action never stops, and Baldacci's trademark pacing keeps the reader turning pages until the denouement, which unfortunately isn't quite as satisfying as the rest of the novel. <i>--Jane Adams</i><p> </p><p></p><p> <strong>Amazon.com Exclusive Content</strong> </p><p> </p><p></p><p> <b><i>Why Hour Game</i>: An Exclusive Essay by David Baldacci</b> <br></p><p> It's hard not to notice that the majority of fictional serial killers are cut from the same mold.

Innovation is cheaper than advertising, advises Godin who defines the "free prize" with diverse examples including swatch watches, frequent flyer miles, dog bakeries, Tupperware parties and portable shredding trucks. He explains "Design matters, style matters, extras matter." <p> The largest portion of the book is devoted to how to sell an idea to your organization. His specific tactics range from irreverent, (let them pee on your ideas) to practical (how to build a prototype). One standout chapter explains how brainstorming can become boring. His alternative, "edgecraft," involves divergent thinking to add something remarkable to your product. His long grocery list of edges (safety, equality, invisibility, and hours of operation) suggest a genuine marketing manifesto. The ideas are bold and insightful, but can suffer from being presented in less than logical order. The book is also diminished by Godin's self-marketing, from using terminology in his previous books to naming key ideas after himself. These advertisements are unnecessary. This nervy little volume is bound to mother many inventions. <i>--Barbara Mackoff</i></p>Seth Godin is an entrepreneur, a sought-after lecturer, a monthly columnist for <i>Fast Company</i>, and an all-around business gadfly.

To the physiognomist, body shape and facial features reveal every aspect of personality, expose every secret, and even predict the future. When Drachton Below, Master of the Well-Built City, sends his premier physiognomist into the primitive outlands to uncover the thief of an unperishing fruit that may grant immortality, Cley discovers love and the truth about physiognomy. His discoveries unleash horrific destruction and plunge him into Hell--and neither he nor the Master can foresee their revolutionary fate of their world.<p> A <i>New York Times</i> Notable Book and the winner of the 1998 World Fantasy Award, <i>The Physiognomy</i> may be read with equal success as either fantasy or SF, but it does not much resemble the fiction of either genre. This novel's closest relatives are <i>In the Well-Built City</i>, Dante's <i>Divine Comedy</i>, Kafka's black allegories, and Caleb Carr's crime thriller <i>The Alienist</i>.

Every discovery by Stach turns on its head the stereotypical version of the tortured neurotic&#x2015;and as each one chips away at the monolithic dark Kafka, the keynote, of all things, becomes laughter.</p><p><em>For Is that Kafka?</em> Stach has assembled 99 of his most exciting discoveries, culling the choicest, most entertaining bits, and adding his knowledge-able commentaries. Illustrated with dozens of previously unknown images, this volume is a singular literary pleasure.</p></p><p><p><strong>Reiner Stach</strong>, born in 1951 in Saxony, is the author of the definitive biography of Kafka. The first two volumes, published by Princeton University Press, received starred reviews from Publishers Weekly (&#x201c;superb&#x201d;), Library Journal (&#x201c;a monumental accomplishment&#x201d;), Kirkus (&#x201c;essential&#x201d;), and Booklist (&#x201c;masterful&#x201d;). &#x201c;I can&#x2019;t say enough about the liveliness and richness of Stach&#x2019;s book,&#x201d; Michael Dirda exclaimed in The Washington Post. &#x201c;Every page feels excited, dynamic, utterly alive.&#x201d;</p><p>In 2010 <strong>Kurt Beals</strong> was a finalist for the Best Translated Book Award for Anja Utler's <em>engulf&#x2013;enkindle</em>, and in 2012 he won the first ever German Book Office Translation Prize.

Along with minimal commentary, he submits ninety-nine numbered exhibition items&#x2015;documents, photographs, objects, scribbles, and doodles&#x2015;for our consideration. The result is a box of fancy Austro-Hungarian chocolates...&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Avi Steinberg, <em>The New Yorker</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Each turn Stach makes adds nuance to his skillfully collaged portrait of Kafka.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>The Quarterly Conversation</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;&#x201c;Is that Kafka?&#x201d; indirectly contributes to an on going scholarly project, in Europe and America, to revisit many of the assumptions about the writer and his work, in effect, to move beyond the myths and clich�s.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Michael Dirda, <em>The Washington Post</em></strong></p><h2>Flowers: Charles Rennie Mackintosh</h2><p>Pamela Robertson, an acknowledged authority on Mackintosh, examines the artist's use of plant forms as decorative and formal sources for his designs in architecture, interiors, textiles, and graphics. She shows the ways in which nature provided lifelong inspiration for his work and analyzes his recurring use of the rose, a design motif which held a special significance as a symbol of art, beauty, and love for both Mackintosh and his artist wife, Margaret Macdonald. In addition, the author looks at Mackintosh's paintings and designs in relation to the work of contemporary symbolists, Japanese floral art, and the European tradition of scientific botanical illustration.<br>Mackintosh's renowned skills as a draftsman are immediately apparent in his flower paintings. The sixty full-page colorplates presented here reveal early pencil sketchbook drawings done while Mackintosh was an apprentice architect and a student at the Glasgow School of Art, watercolors made on England's North Sea coast in 1914-15, and sophisticated still-life compositions of later years. Reproduced as well are striking floral-based textile designs of the 1920s, abstractions that placed him at the forefront of Britain's avant-garde movement. Photographs of his work in architecture and interiors are also included.</p><p>Pamela Robertson is curator of the world-famous Mackintosh Collection at the Hunterian Art Gallery, University of Glasgow.These two works on Scottish designer-artist-architect Mackintosh complement each other nicely. By the curator of the University of Glasgow's Mackintosh Collection, Flowers highlights one of the more prominent motifs that runs throughout his prolific career, which includes architectural and interior design, textiles, and graphic works. The spectacular colorplates reveal his profound artistry, mastery of subject matter, and technique of design. Chapters focus on Mackintosh's ability as a master architectural draftsman and botanical illustrator, as well as his stylized plant forms and baskets of flowers. Addressing her subject more broadly, Wilhide (William Morris, LJ 2/1/92) devotes the opening section to Mackintosh's life, including the influence and contribution of his wife, Margaret Macdonald, and his work with the Glasgow School of Art, the Four, and the architectural firm of Honeyman, Keppie and Mackintosh. Section 2 focuses on the new Glasgow Style, frequently associated with Art Nouveau and the Arts and Crafts movement, and Section 3 encompasses the art of space and Mackintosh's exceptional architectural projects and various interiors. Section 4 concentrates on the elements of his style, which featured sparsely arranged and furnished rooms, the use of the color white, stenciling, rigorous use of geometric shapes, and his most famous ebonized high-back chairs. The appendixes include a list of Mackintosh sites to visit in Scotland, England, and France and a list of sources of Mackintosh designs in both Europe and the United States. These two books provide welcome insight into the life and career of Mackintosh and are recommended for libraries emphasizing architecture and decorative arts.<br><i>Stephen Allan Patrick, East Tennessee State Univ.

Country by country, the authors describe in detail all of the fortifications built prior to and during World War II. The fortifications of smaller countries, like Belgium and the Netherlands, which added important segments to larger defensive lines, are covered with the same attention to detail as the more well-known fortifications. Much new information is available here on the defenses in Eastern Europe, as well. The descriptions and technical specifications of Europe&#39;s forts are supplemented by scores of remarkable technical drawings by Polish artist Robert M. Jurga.</p><p><b>J.E.

That question has been the cause of much controversy in France, and according to this comprehensive indictment, "the verdict on Vichy must be guilty." Rutgers political science professor Curtis argues that Vichy's anti-Semitic policies were "a deliberate, autonomous French government policy rather than...a response to German pressure." Vichy passed laws to strip Jews of their civil rights, seize their assets and exclude them from most professions. Worse, the French police apparatus organized and carried out the rounding up of Jews for deportation to the death camps, a task that the small German police contingent in France would have been hard-pressed to accomplish. With more freedom of action than most of occupied Europe, Curtis argues, Vichy was far more complicit in the Final Solution, especially in comparison with occupied Denmark and even the Axis governments in Bulgaria and Fascist Italy, which took concerted action-or at the very least, were less inclined to enforce discriminatory laws-to protect Jews under their jurisdiction. Curtis sets Vichy policy in the context of pre-war right wing and anti-Semitic political tendencies, and explores the post-war consensus that sought to downplay Vichy collaboration in favor of a mythology of heroic national Resistance to the Germans. He goes beyond the Vichy officials themselves to explore the acquiescence or silence of French society-the legal establishment, Church leaders, even left intellectuals like Sartre and de Beauvoir-in the face of anti-Semitic persecution. Drawing on the latest research, Curtis provides a comprehensive, nuanced but morally uncompromising look at France's darkest hour. 8 pages of b&amp;w photos. <br>Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Murder a la Mode</h2><p>1983, first Owl Book Ed., 8th printing.

Included are early explorers, fur traders, gold min ers, soldiers, homesteaders, cowboys, mail order brides, and others. Of these, only black cowboys, such as the thou sands who drove cattle up the Chisolm Trail, were treated as equals by their peers. Discrimination in many forms is documented here. Because many American black history books tend to focus on events occuring in the south and the northeast, this title is a valuable supplemental source. A serious flaw is the skimpy index, which lacks name ac cess for many of the blacks whose fas cinating stories are included. Since the last edition (Anchor, 1973), a chapter on black women of the West has been added to increase the scope of this dy namic book.

Within, readers learned how to address a senator, how to propose or decline a proposal of marriage, how to console a friend on the death of a loved one, and even how to attend to one's toilette. </p><p>On "Speaking One's Mind," he writes that "certain honest but unthinking people often commit the grievous mistake of 'speaking their mind' on all occasions and under all circumstances, and oftentimes to the great mortification of their hearers . . . a little reflection ought to show how cruel and unjust this is." </p><p>In a section entitled "The Relations of an Engaged Couple," he writes that "A lady should not be too demonstrative of her affection during the days of her engagement. There is always the chance of �a slip 'twixt the cup and the lip.'" </p><p>On being presented to the Court of St. James-presumably something everyone should do at least once-he tells us that "It is desirable to be early to escape the crowd. . . .

A gift of dandelions is an invitation to a bout of Victorian debauchery. But it is much more than a collection of rules, and most of Young's advice about how to navigate the quirky mores of the nineteenth century are as commonsensical now as they were then. It is also surprisingly progressive.

She was meant to die because she was pregnant and unmarried, bringing disgrace to her parents. But she survived, and now, 25 years later, "Souad" bears witness to the horror of "honor crimes" that kill thousands of women every year in many countries across the world. She begins with a bitter account of what it was like to grow up female in a remote Palestinian village in the Occupied Territory. "Being born a girl was a curse." Unlike her brother, she never went to school. Her father beat her daily. She worked as a shepherd, a "consenting slave." She barely glimpsed the city, where women were free to work and move around. Her rescuer was Jacqueline, a European aid worker, who was in the Middle East to care for children in distress and who arranged for the badly burned young woman to be flown to Switzerland, where she and her newborn baby received medical care and support. Today Souad is "somewhere in Europe," married with three children, her testimony still anonymous for her protection. Occasional chapters by Jacqueline fill in the wider context, but it's the immediacy of the shocking first-person narrative that drives home the statistics.

Not only did nearly 58,000 Americans die there, but--by some estimates--1.5 million veterans returned with war-induced Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). This psychological syndrome, responsible for anxiety, depression, and a wide array of social pathologies, has never before been placed in historical context. Eric Dean does just that as he relates the psychological problems of veterans of the Vietnam War to the mental and readjustment problems experienced by veterans of the Civil War. </p><p> Employing a multidisciplinary approach that merges military, medical, and social history, Dean draws on individual case analyses and quantitative methods to trace the reactions of Civil War veterans to combat and death. He seeks to determine whether exuberant parades in the North and sectional adulation in the South helped to wash away memories of violence for the Civil War veteran. His extensive study reveals that Civil War veterans experienced severe persistent psychological problems such as depression, anxiety, and flashbacks with resulting behaviors such as suicide, alcoholism, and domestic violence. By comparing Civil War and Vietnam veterans, Dean demonstrates that Vietnam vets did not suffer exceptionally in the number and degree of their psychiatric illnesses. The politics and culture of the times, Dean argues, were responsible for the claims of singularity for the suffering Vietnam veterans as well as for the development of the modern concept of PTSD. </p><p> This remarkable and moving book uncovers a hidden chapter of Civil War history and gives new meaning to the Vietnam War. </p></p><p>Eric T. Dean Jr., a lawyer whose interest in the Civil War prompted him to return to school to obtain a Ph.D. in history, makes a unique contribution to Civil War studies with his research on the psychological effects of the war on its veterans. Digging through the pension records of Civil War vets, Dean documents the great number who, suffering from severe psychological problems triggered by intense combat experience, were dutifully provided with disability pensions by the U.S. government. Dean's central thesis--that these veterans provide a mirror for the experiences of their counterparts in Vietnam a century later--is supported with lucid reasoning. Of particular interest are the many stories of intense Civil War combat and its psychological aftereffects, including many cases of Civil War veterans committed to asylums well into the 1890s--case studies seldom found in standard histories which offer painful testimony to the war's enormous impact on the nation. <i>--Robert McNamara</i>Winner of the Award for the Best Book in Political Psychology of the American Political Science Association</p><h2>Mike Force</h2><p>A first-hand report from a highly decorated Green Beret officer recounts his combat time with the Green Beret&#39;s Mobile Strike Force in Vietnam, discussing the Tet offensive and many other missions</p><p>L.

Cumulative verse introduces a train's posse of passengers, all of them noisy: "Elephants stomp in two big packs/ And the troupe of ducks goes quack quack quack/ While dancing around the acrobats/ Who sing on the cars with talking yaks,/ And a red caboose is in the back/ Of the little black train going down the track./ Clickety clack, clickety clack." Mayhem threatens when two mischievous mice light fireworks on the roof of the cabooseAbut Driver Zach quickly restores order (and quiet) by telling everyone to "pipe down" or "we'll change our tack./ We'll stop going forward... and we'll head right back." Spengler, having made the most of the passengers' high jinks, brings fun even into the silencing sequence. The ducks hold wings to beaks, as if whispering "Shh!" and the assembly appears just to be biding time until the next uproar (the final scene shows a third prankish mouse scrambling to join the train). The deeply saturated colors recall the intensity of Robert Bender's illustrations, but the lines are looser and the compositions have their own puckish sensibility. Kids will enjoy the good-natured decrescendo just as much as the invitation to turn up the volume. Ages 4-8. (May) <br>Copyright 1999 Reed Business Information, Inc.PreSchool-Grade 2-The Spences build their story around tried-and-true motifs. As "A little black train goes down the track./Clickety clack, clickety clack," more and more passengers are added, ? la John Burningham's Mr. Gumpy's Motorcar (Crowell, 1976), and the noise level increases as well, ? la Ann McGovern's Too Much Noise (Houghton, 1967). The first passengers are talking yaks, who are joined by singing acrobats, quacking ducks, and a few stomping elephants for good measure. When two mice set off fireworks, the engineer has had enough and threatens to turn the train around. Properly chastened, the whole menagerie quiets down and the book trails off with just the "clickety clack" of the wheels. The action is set to a driving rhyme scheme. Spengler's richly hued paintings make the most of the humorous situations. The double-page spreads are crammed with roly-poly characters. The ending is a bit of a downer in that the travelers all look so sad after the engineer yells at them, in marked contrast to the good time they were having.<br><i>Judith Gloyer, Milwaukee Public Library </i><br>Copyright 1999 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Seven Valleys Revealed</h2><p><p>This work has been selected by scholars as being culturally important and is part of the knowledge base of civilization as we know it.</p><p>This work is in the public domain in the United States of America, and possibly other nations.

His honesty, energy, and clear restlessness illuminate each page, drawing the reader in to a life of great achievement in spite of some hurdles. The highest of those hurdles may have been his difficulty with romantic love. The origin of that difficulty can be traced to his mother&#x2019;s severe reaction upon learning that he was gay: she called him &#x201c;an abomination.&#x201d; Sacks forgave his mother for that, even if he couldn&#x2019;t shake her words. His solution appears to have been just to move on and keep moving&#x2014;and the entire book is imbued with a sense of movement. This can be seen in his love of motorcycles and weight lifting, in his desire to travel, in his move from England to the United States, and even when he writes of his former addiction to amphetamines. Of course his mind was moving at all times as well, and in this book Sacks continues to write convincingly about the ways our minds make us human. Despite claiming shyness, Sacks amassed an impressive list of friends and acquaintances&#x2014;from the poets Thom Gunn, Richard Selig, and W.H. Auden, to Francis Crick and Stephen Jay Gould, to Robert De Niro and Robin Williams. And there was always the writing. &#x201c;I am a storyteller, for better and for worse,&#x201d; he writes at the end of the book.

Arranged alphabetically, the dictionary starts with Abbo of Fleury, ends with Zosimus of Syracuse, and includes Pelagia of Antioch, Crispina of Tagora, Cunegund the empress, and a wide assortment of other martyrs, popes, spiritual seers, and those, such as Crispin of Viterbo, who were canonized simply for their humble lives and Christian faith. There's also a wonderful appendix of the principal patronages of saints--telling, for example, who's the patron saint of healthy dogs (Hubert) and mad dogs (Sithney), plus an index of the main iconographical emblems of saints, another of places, and a calendar of feast days. <i>--Stephanie Gold</i><br><strong>David Hugh Farmer</strong>, formerly Reader in History at Reading University, is the author or editor of nine books.<br></p><h2>The Art &amp; Adventure of Beekeeping</h2><p>Book by Ormond Aebi, Harry Aebi</p><p></p><h2>A Hundred Feet Over Hell: Flying With the Men of the 220th Recon Airplane Company Over I Corps and the DMZ, Vietnam 1968-1969</h2><p><p><i>A Hundred Feet Over Hell </i>is the story of a handful of young pilots taking extraordinary risks to support those on the ground.

Unlike the U.S. Army aerial forward observers farther south, who could only direct field artillery against enemy targets, Catkillers were authorized and trained to control air strikes, which they did regularly in support of both marine and army ground units.

Bullet holes in their aircraft were so common that they were barely worthy of mention. When crossing the Ben Hai River into North Vietnam in search of enemy artillery, flying at 120 miles per hour in the sights of an array of anti-aircraft weapons, only good fortune kept more Catkillers from being lost. The stories of these valiant men in their small planes has been largely overlooked before, but the risks they took on a daily basis ensured more U.S. servicemen made it home. <i>A Hundred Feet Over Hell</i> ensures their stories are not forgotten, as the men relive their missions in their own words.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><p>Jim Hooper is a war correspondent and author.

Lida is determined to watch out for her little sister, Larissa, but she's rendered unconscious soon after being captured by Nazi soldiers. She awakens to find herself in a dark, filthy railroad car jammed with other Ukrainian children. Lida is one of the "lucky ones" because soldiers have decided she can be of value to them. She is devastated that she has been separated from her younger sister and can only fear the worst. Even though the other children in the railroad car are strangers to one another, they all quickly bond. Once they reach the end of their journey, Lida and her new friends are herded into a labor camp, divided up, and given various tasks. The children come to realize they will be worked until they are too weak to function, then killed. Lida works in a factory making bombs that will be used to kill soldiers who are fighting to end the Nazi reign. With tremendous courage, Lida and her friends begin a sabotage plan, despite the threat of death if they are discovered. Students will admire Lida's pluck amid such heinous conditions. Scenes of the labor camp convey the horrors without graphic description.

Walking the streets of New York with Norton tucked into his pocket, Gethers began forming an intense attachment to his new pet. Before long Norton was flying with his owner on the Concorde to Europe, sipping milk in Parisian caf�s, and eating custom-made pounce pizzas at Spago. Soon Gethers began to detail Norton&#x2019;s adventures in print, and with <i>The Cat Who Went to Paris</i> and <i>A Cat Abroad</i> the duo made history as well as many, many friends around the world. <br><br><i>The Cat Who&#x2019;ll Live Forever</i> chronicles the latest in Norton&#x2019;s astonishing adventures, celebrity encounters, and worldwide excursions, culminating in his heartwarming�and heartbreaking�final cross-country trip.

However, after a series of strange events start to parallel the lives of both Taylors--fictional and real--Tom realizes that he might be the character on page made flesh. <br><br>In this first-ever original graphic novel spinning off from the pages of the critically acclaimed THE UNWRITTEN series, writer Mike Carey explores the origins behind Tom's mysterious powers and the odyssey his father has sent him on.</p><p>Writer Mike Carey, best known for his work on Vertigo's THE UNWRITTEN, LUCIFER and JOHN CONSTANTINE, HELLBLAZER has made his mark in comics.&nbsp; Born in Liverpool, England, Carey worked as a teacher for fifteen years before gaining regular work writing for several independent companies.

Tom Taylor is magically linked to the fictional character, Tommy Taylor, from the fantasy book series written by his father, Wilson Taylor. While looking for his missing dad, Tom and friends cross over into this fantasy world, and fiction slowly becomes reality. The fictional Tommy receives his magical powers in this volume, and in a parallel narrative, Wilson crafts his first book, and orchestrates a twisted publicity stunt to make his son and his book character the same person in the eyes of the public. This is the first time that Carey has tackled these subjects, so longtime fans of Carey's comics will be eager to pick this up, while those new to this world may be confused about the complexity of the two plots. Both story lines are equally compelling and balance each other out wonderfully&#x2014;Tommy's sections is filled with magical adventures and Harry Potter&#x2014;esque whimsy, while Wilson's tale is filled with dark, psychological mind games. Art style and coloring changes throughout the piece to perfectly match the changing moods&#x2014;an epic storm at sea is drawn with rich pastel and heavy-textured color, while scenes of Wilson are often drawn with simple lines and blue-shading.

Many photographs of the man throughout his life. Russell Crowe (pictured on the cover) portrayed him in the movie, &#39;A Beautiful Mind.&#39;</p><p>Stories of famously eccentric Princetonians abound--such as that of chemist Hubert Alyea, the model for <i>The Absent-Minded Professor</i>, or Ralph Nader, said to have had his own key to the library as an undergraduate. Or the "Phantom of Fine Hall," a figure many students had seen shuffling around the corridors of the math and physics building wearing purple sneakers and writing numerology treatises on the blackboards. The Phantom was John Nash, one of the most brilliant mathematicians of his generation, who had spiraled into schizophrenia in the 1950s. His most important work had been in game theory, which by the 1980s was underpinning a large part of economics. When the Nobel Prize committee began debating a prize for game theory, Nash's name inevitably came up--only to be dismissed, since the prize clearly could not go to a madman. But in 1994 Nash, in remission from schizophrenia, shared the Nobel Prize in economics for work done some 45 years previously.<p>Economist and journalist Sylvia Nasar has written a biography of Nash that looks at all sides of his life. She gives an intelligent, understandable exposition of his mathematical ideas and a picture of schizophrenia that is evocative but decidedly unromantic. Her story of the machinations behind Nash's Nobel is fascinating and one of very few such accounts available in print (the CIA could learn a thing or two from the Nobel committees). This highly recommended book is indeed "a story about the mystery of the human mind, in three acts: genius, madness, reawakening." <i>--Mary Ellen Curtin</i></p>A former economics correspondent for the <i>New York Times,</i> <b>Sylvia Nasar</b> is the Knight Professor of Journalism at Columbia University.

Brilliantly reproduced original artworks by such renowned artists as Audubon, Gould, MacGillivray, Thorburn, and Wolfe are included.<br>The lively accompanying text tells the story of how ornithological art grew out of the naturalistic tradition of European painting to become a genre on its own, where the artist&#x2019;s focus on aesthetic appeal was married to the scientist&#x2019;s need for precision and detail. <br>Many of the works reproduced in this volume have never before been published.

Here the chief character is retired sheriff Hank Bohannon, owner-manager of a California horse ranch. The old man leaves his haven only when called upon to search for evidence of criminal guilt or innocence, in the case of "Snipe Hunt," for instance. A pretty girl, Billie Shears, begs Bohannon to save a youth she loves, Dennis Toomy, codefendant with Melanie Kruger, on the charge of murdering her husband, Thomas, a rich banker. The police have letters exchanged by Dennis and Melanie that virtually guarantee their conviction. Of all the stories, this one represents most impressively a purely deductive process and a spectacular upset. Conversely, the theme in "Witch's Broom" is relentless suspense, with Bohannon racing the clock to save a small kidnap victim. There is enough variety in this mixed bag to satisfy any mystery fan. <br>Copyright 1988 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Runner</h2><p>A top Chinese swimmer kills himself on the eve of an international event. An Olympic weightlifter dies in the arms of his Beijing mistress. But the suicide was murder and both men&#39;s deaths are connected to a sinister series of killings. Beijing detective Li Yan finds himself in charge of what could be his last investigation for the Chines police. Li&#39;s only hope of a breakthrough is a champion runner, the sole member of the athletics team who seems willing to talk. But she will only talk to American pathologist Margaret Campbell - and now, the runner has disappeared. As Li&#39;s enemies take their chance to destroy his career, and shadowy figures seem hell-bent on victory at any cost, finding the missing runner seems to be the only way to save his joband the lives of more young athletes.</p><p>Peter May has been a journalist (Scotsman, Glasgow Evening Times), a writer on the hugely successful Scottish TV soap opera Take the High Road and the creator of three TV series: The Standard, Squadron and Machair, which is the Gaelic-language equivalent of Brookside.

Vance brings his superior narrating skills to May&#39;s police procedural starring the detective team of Li Yan, chief of the Beijing Municipal Police, and Margaret Campbell, a forensic pathologist who is Li Yan&#39;s American fianc�e. China&#39;s top athletes are being murdered. Three members of China&#39;s sprint-relay team, a cyclist, a top swimmer, and a world-class weight lifter are dead. A female runner appeals to Margaret, fearing she will be next.

The series finale finds Beck attempting to save an American diplomat from the bloody hands of a terrorist group.<br><br> The book is, in effect, a marvelous summing up of the series. The story centers on the visit of an American senator to Stockholm. Martin Beck tries to protect him from an international gang of terrorists, while they decide that Beck too should be removed from the scene. Interwoven with this basic story are two fascinating subplots. One, a classic mini-mystery, is the story of a millionaire pornographer bludgeoned to death in his own bathtub. The other is the story of a young girl, a Swedish hippie caught up unexpectedly in the maze of police bureaucracy. As in other Martin Beck books, the plot comes together in a totally unexpected climax.</p><p>MAJ SJOWALL AND PER WAHLOO, her husband and coauthor, wrote ten Martin Beck mysteries. Mr. Wahloo, who died in 1975 was a reporter for several Swedish newspapers and magazines and wrote numerous radio and television plays, film scripts, short stories and novels. Maj Sjowall is also a poet.Chapter 1<br><br>The National Commissioner of Police smiled. <br><br>He usually reserved his smile, boyish and charming, for the press and television and only seldom bestowed it on such members of the inner circle as Superintendent Stig Malm, of the National Police Administration, Eric M�ller, chief of Security Police, and Martin Beck, chief of the National Homicide Squad. <br><br>Only one of the three men smiled back. Stig Malm had beautiful white teeth and liked smiling to show them off. Over the years he had quite unconsciously acquired a whole register of smiles. The one he was using now could only be described as ingratiating and fawning. &nbsp; <br><br>The chief of the Security Police suppressed yawn and Martin Beck blew his nose. It was only half-past seven in the morning, the National Commissioner&#x2019;s favorite time for calling sudden meetings, which in no way meant that he was in the habit of arriving at the station at that time. He often did not appear until late in the morning and even then he was usually inaccessible even to his closest colleagues. "My office is my castle" might well have been inscribed on the door, and indeed it was an impenetrable fortress, guarded by a well-groomed secretary, quite rightly called "The Dragon." <br><br>This morning he was showing his breezy and benign side. He had even had a Thermos of coffee and real china cups brought in, instead of the usual plastic mugs. <br><br>Stig Malm got up and poured out the coffee. <br><br>Martin Beck knew that before he sat down again he would first pinch the crease in his trousers and then carefully run his hand across his well-cut wavy hair. <br><br>Stig Malm was his immediate superior and Martin Beck had no respect for him whatsoever. His self-satisfied coquettishness and insinuating officiousness toward senior potentates were characteristics that Martin Beck had ceased to be annoyed by and nowadays found simply foolish. What did irritate him, on the other hand, and often constituted an obstacle to his work, was the man's rigidity and lack of self-criticism, a lack just as total and destructive as his ignorance of everything to do with practical police work. That he had risen to such a high position was due to ambition, political opportunism and a certain amount of administrative ability. <br><br>The chief of the Security Police put four lumps of sugar into his coffee, stirred it with a spoon and slurped as he drank.<br><br>Maim drank his without sugar, careful as he was of his trim figure.<br><br>Martin Beck was not feeling well and did not want coffee this early in the morning. <br><br>The National Commissioner took both sugar and cream and crooked his little finger as he raised his cup. He emptied it in one gulp and pushed it away from him, simultaneously pulling toward him a green file that had been lying on the corner of the polished conference table. <br><br>"There," he said, smiling again. "Coffee first and then on with the day's work." <br><br>Martin Beck looked gloomily at his untouched cup of coffee and longed for a glass of cold milk. <br><br>"How are you feeling, Martin?" said the Commissioner, with feigned sympathy in his voice. "You don't look well. You're not planning to be ill again, are you? You know we can't afford to be without you." <br><br>Martin was not planning to be ill. He already was ill. He had been drinking wine with his twenty-two-year-old daughter and her boy friend until half-past three in the morning and knew that he looked awful as a result. But he had no desire to discuss his self-inflicted indisposition with his superior, and moreover he didn't think that the "again" was really fair. He had been away from work with the flu and a high temperature for three days at the beginning of March and it was now the seventh of May. <br><br>"No," he said. "I'm fine. A bit of a cold, that's all." <br><br>"You really don't look good," said Stig Malm. There was not even feigned sympathy in his voice, only reproach. "You really don't."<br><br>He looked piercingly at Martin Beck, who feeling his irritation rising said, "Thanks for your concern, but I'm fine. I assume we're not here to discuss my appearance or the state of my health." <br><br>"Quite right," said the Commissioner. "Let's get down to business." He opened the green file. Judging by the contents&#x2014;three or four sheets of paper at the most&#x2014;there was some hope that today's meeting would not drag on for too long. <br><br>On top lay a typed letter with the mark of a large green rubber stamp beneath the scrawled signature and a letterhead that Martin Beck could not make out from where he was sitting. <br><br>"As you will remember, we have discussed our to some extent imperfect experience when it comes to the security measures to be taken during state visits and in similar delicate situations&#x2014;occasions when one can expect demonstrations of a particularly aggressive nature and well-and less-well-planned attempts at assassination," the Commissioner began, falling automatically into the pompous style that usually characterized his public appearances. <br><br>Stig Malm mumbled in agreement, Martin Beck said nothing, but Eric M�ller objected. "Well, we're not that inexperienced, are we? Khrushchev's visit went off fine, except maybe for that red-painted pig someone let loose in front of Log�rd steps. So did Kosygin's, organizationally as well as security-wise. And the Environmental Conference, to take a maybe slightly different example." <br><br>"Yes, of course, but this time we're faced with a more difficult problem. What I'm referring to is the visit by this senator from the United States at the end of November. It could turn out to be a hot potato, if I may use that expression. We've never been confronted with the problem of VIPs from the States before, but now we are. The date's been set and I've already received certain instructions. Our preparations must be made well ahead of time and be extremely thorough. We have to be prepared for anything." <br><br>The National Commissioner was no longer smiling. "We'll probably have to be prepared for something more violent than egg-throwing this time," he added grimly. "You should bear that in mind, Eric." <br><br>"We can take preventive measures," said M�ller. <br><br>The Commissioner shrugged. "To some extent, yes," he said. "But we can't eliminate and lock up and intern everyone who might make trouble. You know that as well as I do. I've got my orders to go by and you'll be getting yours." <br><br>And I've got mine, thought Martin Beck gloomily. He was still trying to read the letterhead on the letter in the green file. He thought he could discern the word "police" or possibly "policia." His eyes ached and his tongue felt as rough and dry as sandpaper. Reluctantly he sipped at the bitter coffee. <br><br>"But all that will come later," said the Commissioner. "What I want to discuss today is this letter." He tapped the paper in the open file with his forefinger. "It is in every way relevant to the problem at hand," he said. He gave the letter to Stig Malm, to pass around the table before he continued. <br><br>"It is, as you see, an invitation, in response to our request to be allowed to send an observer during an impending state visit. As the visiting president is not particularly popular in the host country, they will be taking all possible measures to protect him. As in many other Latin American countries, they have had to deal with a number of assassination attempts&#x2014;of both native and foreign politicians. Consequently, they have considerable experience, and I would think that their police force and security services are the best qualified in that area. I'm convinced that we could learn much by studying their methods and procedures." <br><br>Martin Beck glanced through the letter, which was written in English in very formal and courteous terms. The president's visit was to take place on the fifth of June, hardly a month away, and the representative of the Swedish police was welcome to arrive two weeks earlier, so that he could study the most important phases of the preparatory work. The signature was elegant and totally illegible, but elucidated in typescript. The name was Spanish, long, and appeared in some way to be noble and distinguished. <br><br>When the letter had been returned to the green file, the Commissioner said, "The problem is, who shall we send?" <br><br>Stig Malm thoughtfully raised his eyes to the ceiling, but said nothing. <br><br>Martin Beck feared that he himself might be suggested. Five years earlier, before he had broken out of his unhappy marriage, he would have been delighted to undertake an assignment that would take him away from home for a while. But now, the last thing he wanted to do was to go abroad, and he hastened to say, "This is more of a Security Service job, isn't it?" <br><br>"I can't go," said M�ller. "In the first place, I can't be absent from the department&#x2014;we've got some reorganizational problems in Section A that will take some time to clear up. In the second place, we're already experts on these matters and it would be more useful if someone went who was unfamiliar with security questions. Someone from the Criminal Investigation Bureau, or maybe someone from the Regular Police. Whoever goes will pass on what he learns to the rest of us when he gets back, so everyone will benefit anyway." <br><br>The Commissioner nodded. "Yes, there's something in what you say, Eric," he said. "And, as you point out, we can't spare you at the moment. Nor you, Martin." <br><br>Martin Beck inwardly sighed with relief. <br><br>"In addition, I cannot speak Spanish," said the chief of Security Police. <br><br>"Who the hell can?" said Malm, smiling. He was aware of the fact that the Commissioner did not master the Castilian language, either. <br><br>"I know someone who can," said Martin Beck. <br><br>Malm raised his eyebrows. "Who? Someone in Criminal Investigation?" <br><br>"Yes. Gunvald Larsson." <br><br>Malm raised his eyebrows yet another millimeter, then smiled incredulously and said, "But we can't send him, can we now?"<br><br>"Why not?" said Martin Beck. "I think he'd be a good man to send." <br><br>He noticed that he sounded slightly angry. He did not usually speak up for Gunvald Larsson, but Malm's tone of voice had annoyed him and he was so used to disagreeing with Malm that he opposed him almost automatically. <br><br>"He's a bungler and totally unrepresentative of the force," said Malm.<br><br>"Does he really speak Spanish?" asked the Commissioner doubtfully. "Where did he learn it?" <br><br>"He was in a lot of Spanish-speaking countries when he was a sailor," said Martin Beck. "The city we're talking about is a large port, so he's almost certainly been there before. He speaks English, French and German, too, all fluently. And a little Russian. Look in his file and you'll see." <br><br>"He's a bungler all the same," insisted Stig Malm. <br><br>The Commissioner looked thoughtful. "I'll look at his qualifications," he said. "I thought of him myself, as a matter of fact. It's true he has a tendency to behave somewhat boorishly, and he's much too undisciplined. But he's undeniably one of our best inspectors, even if he does find it difficult to obey orders and stick to regulations." <br><br>He turned to the chief of the Security Police. "What do you say, Eric? Do you think he'd be suitable?"<br><br>"Well, I don't like him much, but generally speaking I've no objections." <br><br>Malm looked unhappy. "I think it would be extremely inappropriate to send him," he said. "He would disgrace the Swedish force. He behaves like a boor and uses language more suited to a longshoreman than a former ship's officer." <br><br>"Perhaps not when he's speaking Spanish," said Martin Beck. "Anyway, even if he does express himself a little crudely sometimes, at least he chooses his moments." <br><br>That was not strictly true. Martin Beck had recently heard Gunvald Larsson call MaIm "that magnificent asshole" in the man's presence, but fortunately Maim had not realized that the epithet was intended for him. <br><br>The Commissioner did not seem to take much notice of Malm's objections. "It's perhaps not a bad idea," he said thoughtfully. "I don't think his tendency to uncivilized behavior will be much of a problem in this case. He can behave well if he wants to. He has a better background than most. He comes from a wealthy and cultured family, he's had the best possible education and an upbringing that has taught him how to behave correctly in all possible circumstances. That shows, even if he does his best to conceal it." <br><br>"You can say that again," mumbled Malm. <br><br>Martin Beck sensed that Stig Malm would very much have liked the assignment and that he was annoyed at not even being asked. He also thought it would be good to be rid of Gunvald Larsson for a while, as he was not much liked by his colleagues and had an unusual capacity for causing rows and complications. <br><br>The Commissioner did not seem wholly convinced even by his own reasoning, and Martin Beck said encouragingly, "I think we should send Gunvald. He has all the qualifications needed for the job." <br><br>"I've noticed that he's careful of his appearance," said the Commissioner. "His way of dressing shows good taste and a feeling for quality. That undoubtedly makes an impression." <br><br>"Exactly," said Martin Beck. "It's an important detail." He was conscious of the fact that his own clothing could hardly be called tasteful. His trousers were unpressed and baggy, the collar of his polo sweater was wide and limp from many washings, his tweed jacket was worn and missing a button. <br><br>"The Violence Division is well-staffed and ought to be able to manage without Larsson for a few weeks," said the Commissioner. "Or does anyone have any other suggestion?" <br><br>They all shook their heads. Even Malm appeared to have perceived the advantage of having Gunvald Larsson at a safe distance for a while, and Eric M�ller yawned again, apparently pleased that the meeting was drawing to a close. <br><br>The National Commissioner rose to his feet and closed the file. "Good," he said. "Then we are agreed. I shall personally inform Larsson of our decision."</p><h2>Orphan Train (Kennebec Large Print superior collection)</h2><p>Close to aging out of the foster care system, Penobscot Indian Molly Ayer takes a community service position helping an elderly woman named Vivian clean out her home and discovers that they are more alike than different as she helps VIvian solve a mystery from her past.

Since then, this book has stood the test of time as a clear guide to what philosophy is and how to philosophize. Inspired by the Thomistic Revival called for by Leo XIII, Maritain relies heavily on Aristotle and St. Thomas Aquinas to shape a philosophy that, far from sectarian theology in disguise, is driven by reason and engages the modern world. Re-released as part of the Sheed &amp; Ward Classic series, An Introduction to Philosophy is sure to enliven the minds of students and general readers for years to come. From the new introduction by Ralph McInerny: You are about to read a magnificent introduction not only to a kind of philosophy but to philosophizing itself. Jacques Maritain was a relatively young man when he wrote this book, but his effort is one that attracts any philosopher more and more as he grows older. However odd and unusual what he says becomes, the philosopher yearns to show how even the most abstruse claims can be put into relation with what the reader already knows. That, in its essence, is what teaching is. In this book, the reader will find a wise and certain guide into philosophizing as such. And, in the end, he will find that what he reads is really only a refinement and development of what he and everybody else already knew.</p><p>Jacques Maritain was one of the most prolific Catholic philosophers of the 20th century.Text: English, French (translation)</p><h2>Spirited Men: Story, Soul, and Substance</h2><p>This recollection of essays offers resurrections, restorations, reconsiderations, appreciations, enthusiasms, headlong solos, laughing prayers, imaginary meetings with most unusual and most interesting men.</p><p>Brian Doyle is the editor of Portland Magazine. His work has been published in The Atlantic Monthly, The American Scholar, Harper&#39;s, Christian Century, Commonweal, and America. His previous collections include Leaping and Saints Passionate and Peculiar, and he is the editor of God Is Love: Essays from Portland Magazine.Introduction <p>Where Holy Lives </p><p>This book is a collection of resurrections, restorations, reconsiderations, appreciations, enthusiasms, headlong solos, laughing prayers, imaginary meetings with most unusual and most interesting men. </p><p>I wanted to bring these men back to public life, in most cases, or closer to the public eye, in others--to draw them from the shadowy corners of the room and beam a grinning light on them, to sing their stories, to see them fresh and new; and to see them too as very often men of immense spiritual substance, prayerful fury, enormous grace, wonderful attentiveness to miracle: in other words, devout men, in the most real and serious and smiling sense. Men very often concerned in their work and lives with the moral grapple, with the sinuous crucial puzzle of love, with the wonderfully mysterious ways that song and story stoke and spark the heart; which is, as you know and I know, where holy lives. </p><p>Why men? Why not women? Or children? Or herons or sea otters or damselflies or holy oaks? </p><p>Because I am a man, and absorbed by the idea that somehow I might learn how to be a good man, maybe even a great man, before I shuffle off this mortal coil, and something about each of the men in these pages teaches me about being a man: William Blake&#x2019;s relentless eye for the holy, Robert Louis Stevenson&#x2019;s passion and mercy, Van Morrison&#x2019;s endless journey toward wonder and rapture, Paul Kelly&#x2019;s enduring empathy for the ragged brokenness of his fellow human beings, Rider Haggard&#x2019;s idea of honor and friendship as forms of love, Plutarch&#x2019;s insistence that each man has moral greatness within him like a divine seed. </p><p>Each of these troubled talented extraordinary artists fascinated me enough to commit an essay about their lives and works. Maybe in another book I will commit such misdemeanors about Annie Dillard and Flannery O&#x2019;Connor and Rosemary Clooney and Bonnie Raitt and Willa Cather and the great modern Irish poet Nuala Ni Dhomhnaill who hardly anyone has heard of but whose wild honest lusty poems buckle my knees. That would be yet another way to learn about being a good man, if you consider, as I do, that one very fine way to learn about men is to study women studying men. </p><p>I&#x2019;d guess that half the readers of this book are men interested in the shifting threads of greatness in other men, and the other half are women, even more interested in the rich mystery of the characters of men. </p><p>Look: We are all, male and female alike, absorbed by what we might be at our best. We are all chasing after the mysterious nutritious song of the Creator. We are all riveted by art, by how human beings mill their unique and idiosyncratic talents into stories and songs and paintings and dances and sculptures and photographs and plays and films and moments that break your heart, make you howl with laughter, make you sense, for a brief and stunning moment, how brave we are, how foolish, how brief, how holy. </p><p>So this is a book of resurrections and resuscitations of ten men from the vast soup of human beings before and concurrent with you and me. To my mind these are men of eye-popping accomplishment and character who are overlooked, half-forgotten, sentenced to hagiography, or stashed lifeless in the canon rather than seen as very much alive, very much the sorts of people you&#x2019;d happily sit and talk with over a pint of good ale. If the reader feels a spark of increased affection or respect or fellow-feeling for the subjects here after reading my accounts of them, I will be delighted. I have spent many happy days and nights in their company, chatting gaily with Stevenson over a bottle of Bordeaux, arguing about the nature of character with Plutarkos, talking at length with Jim Kjelgaard about the intricate lives of weasels and mink, watching Mister Blake&#x2019;s flashing eyes as he talks of his visions of Christ, listening to Mister Morrison&#x2019;s roaring holy poetry, listening to Paul Desmond tease gently about the memoir that he may or may not have written, and on and on. </p><p>The one profile subject here you would have no occasion whatsoever to know is the late Bob Boehmer of Oregon, but Bob was the most literary and devout man I ever met, and a really wonderful storyteller, and I include him here because he was my dear friend, because I miss him ferociously, and because I&#x2019;d really resurrect him if I could. I can&#x2019;t do that, so I tell you something of his hilarious and sweet story, as a sort of prayer for his soul, now traveled beyond my ken. </p><p>Bob also seems to me a very fine example of the millions of quiet men and women who are great brave fascinating kind-hearted colorful funny hard-working hard-praying tale-tellers, and by sharing some of his long story I want to celebrate and sing so many who live and die and pray generally unremarked by the world. </p><p>We are all storytellers, after all--that, and the headlong pursuit of love, which is the holiest thing of all, and the greatest gift, and the most eloquent proof of God, is what makes us human beings, capable of greatness.</p></p><h2>Well-Chosen Garden</h2><p>Discusses the selection of plants for a garden and offers advice on growing roses, tulips, ferns, herbs, and other garden plants</p><p></p><h2>Working Knowledge</h2><p><p>This influential book establishes the enduring vocabulary and concepts in the burgeoning field of knowledge management.

They categorize knowledge work into four sequential activities--accessing, generating, embedding, and transferring--and look at the key skills, techniques, and processes of each. While they present a practical approach to cataloging and storing knowledge so that employees can easily leverage it throughout the firm, the authors caution readers on the limits of communications and information technology in managing intellectual capital.</p></p><p>When new-car developers at Ford Motor Company wanted to learn why the original Taurus design team was so successful, no one could tell them. No one remembered or had recorded what made that effort so special; the knowledge gained in the Taurus project was lost forever. Indeed, the most valuable asset in any company is probably also its most elusive and difficult to manage: knowledge. Authors Thomas H. Davenport and Laurence Prusak assert that learning how to identify, manage, and foster knowledge is vital for companies who hope to compete in today's fast-moving global economy.<p><i>Working Knowledge</i> examines how knowledge can be nurtured in organizations. Building trust throughout a company is the key to creating a knowledge-oriented corporate culture, a positive environment in which employees are encouraged to make decisions that are efficient, productive, and innovative. The book includes numerous examples of successful knowledge projects at companies such as British Petroleum, 3M, Mobil Oil, and Hewlett-Packard. Concise and clearly written, <i>Working Knowledge</i> is an excellent resource for managers who want to better harness the experience and wisdom within their organizations.</p>Named a Library Journal Best Business Book of 1997.</p><h2>Mr Men Pocket Library</h2><p>BRAND NEW, Exactly same ISBN as listed, Please double check ISBN carefully before ordering.</p><p></p><h2>A Century of Restaurants: Stories and Recipes from 100 of America&#39;s Most Historic and Successful Restaurants</h2><p>Join Rick Browne, best-selling author, host, and producer of <i>Barbecue America</i>, on a pilgrimage to 100 of the oldest and most historic restaurants in America, with interesting profiles of each restaurant, recipes for their signature dishes, and hundreds of photographs that make you feel like you have a seat at the table.<br><br>Come along on a pilgrimage to some of the oldest and most historic restaurants in America in <i>A Century of Restaurants</i>.

The unicorn, alone in her enchanted wood, discovers that she may be the last of her kind. Reluctant at first, she sets out on a journey to find her fellow unicorns, even if it means facing the terrifying anger of the Red Bull and malignant evil of the king who wields his power. Adapted by Peter B. Gillis and lushly illustrated by Renae De Liz and Ray Dillon.</p><p><i>The Last Unicorn</i> is one of the true classics of fantasy, ranking with Tolkien's <i>The Hobbit</i>, Le Guin's Earthsea Trilogy, and Lewis Carroll's <i>Alice in Wonderland</i>. Beagle writes a shimmering prose-poetry, the voice of fairy tales and childhood:<p> </p><blockquote>The unicorn lived in a lilac wood, and she lived all alone. She was very old, though she did not know it, and she was no longer the careless color of sea foam but rather the color of snow falling on a moonlit night. But her eyes were still clear and unwearied, and she still moved like a shadow on the sea.</blockquote><p> The unicorn discovers that she is the last unicorn in the world, and sets off to find the others. She meets Schmendrick the Magician--whose magic seldom works, and never as he intended--when he rescues her from Mommy Fortuna's Midnight Carnival, where only some of the mythical beasts displayed are illusions. They are joined by Molly Grue, who believes in legends despite her experiences with a Robin Hood wannabe and his unmerry men. Ahead wait King Haggard and his Red Bull, who banished unicorns from the land.</p><p> This is a book no fantasy reader should miss; Beagle argues brilliantly the need for magic in our lives and the folly of forgetting to dream. <i>--Nona Vero</i></p><b>Peter S.

Bright and beautiful, Annie is an unlikely candidate for meth. Living fast and hard on the streets of Bend, Oregon, she commits crimes against herself, the community, and her own family.</p><p>The author chronicles her child&#x2019;s addiction in a way that other writers have not written about addiction. What begins as an obsession to save her daughter, and a rage against God for allowing drugs to devour her college-age girl, transforms into release in a life changing letting-go-and-letting-God moment.&nbsp;</p><p>The reader is first introduced to the Stoefen family and Barbara&#x2019;s dream for its idyllic future. Kinks in the perfect life appear. When Annie&#x2019;s alcoholism, drug use, and criminality ensue, Barbara fights to save her. There is all-consuming grief and the devastating loss of not just her daughter, but her dream for her own life as well. Barbara eventually finds support and a new way of thinking. While she continues the battle to save her daughter, she ultimately finds the courage to save herself. The conclusion deals with Annie&#x2019;s recovery&#x2014;and Barbara&#x2019;s. Both experience a spiritual awakening and are transformed. A new and better dream for Barbara&#x2019;s life is born.</p></p><p>Barbara Cofer Stoefen<b> </b>is a drug prevention activist in Oregon and advocate for families with a loved one in active addiction.

She describes something far more wondrous: how the brain comes back on, and how heartbreak and anger can turn into healing and joy. Hers is a voice that parents will not only recognize but need to hear so they too can begin the journey from common tragedy to shared triumph."<b>Kevin McCauley, MD, Founder, Institute for Addiction Study</b><b></b><b></b><br><br>"Barbara Stoefen is a member of the club that none of us ever hoped to belong to, and I'm glad she turned her lessons into helping tools for the rest of us.

This packed-to-the-gills volume features nursery rhymes, riddles, sayings, and songs drawn from the rich traditions of Spanish-speaking cultures. Arranged in thoughtfully introduced sections such as "Canciones de comba / Jump-Rope Songs" and "Adivinanzas / Riddles," the 68 selections appear first in Spanish, followed by a loose recasting of the original in italicized English. Tracey Heffernan is credited with "creative editing of the English," a role that extends beyond strict translation to produce English entries that preserve features such as rhyme, onomatopoeia, and repetition. The results occasionally stray significantly from the originals' sense, so readers hoping to enrich a developing second language won't be particularly well served; others will wish for musical notation and annotations about each entry's cultural origins. (Jose-Luis Orozco's bilingual poetry collections include more of both.) Still, native Spanish speakers wanting to share favorite rhymes with children will relish this book's breadth--and young speakers of either language will appreciate the bouncing rhythms and nonsense fun.

At the heart of these intertwined narratives is a den of coyotes that have recently migrated into the region. Deanna Wolfe, a reclusive wildlife biologist, watches the forest from her outpost in an isolated mountain cabin where she is caught off-guard by Eddie Bondo, a young hunter who comes to invade her most private spaces and confound her self-assured, solitary life. On a farm several miles down the mountain, another web of lives unfolds as Lusa Maluf Landowski, a bookish city girl turned farmer's wife, finds herself unexpectedly marooned in a strange place where she must declare or lose her attachment to the land. And a few more miles down the road, a pair of elderly, feuding neighbors tend their respective farms and wrangle about God, pesticides, and the complexities of a world neither of them expected.</p><p>Over the course of one humid summer, as the urge to procreate overtakes a green and profligate countryside, these characters find connections to one another and to the flora and fauna with which they necessarily share a place. Their discoveries are embedded inside countless intimate lessons of biology, the realities of small farming, and the final, urgent truth that humans are only one part of life on earth.</p><p>With the richness that characterizes Barbara Kingsolver's finest work, <em>Prodigal Summer</em> embraces pure thematic originality and demonstrates a balance of narrative and ideas that only an accomplished novelist could render so beautifully.</p>:</p><p>There is no one in contemporary literature quite like Barbara Kingsolver. Her dialogue sparkles with sassy wit and earthy poetry; her descriptions are rooted in daily life but are also on familiar terms with the eternal. With <i>Prodigal Summer</i>, she returns from the Congo to a "wrinkle on the map that lies between farms and wildness." And there, in an isolated pocket of southern Appalachia, she recounts not one but three intricate stories. <p> Exuberant, lush, riotous--the summer of the novel is "the season of extravagant procreation" in which bullfrogs carelessly lay their jellied masses of eggs in the grass, "apparently confident that their tadpoles would be able to swim through the lawn like little sperms," and in which a woman may learn to "tell time with her skin." It is also the summer in which a family of coyotes moves into the mountains above Zebulon Valley: </p><blockquote> The ghost of a creature long extinct was coming in on silent footprints, returning to the place it had once held in the complex anatomy of this forest like a beating heart returned to its body. This is what she believed she would see, if she watched, at this magical juncture: a restoration. </blockquote> The "she" is Deanna Wolfe, a wildlife biologist observing the coyotes from her isolated aerie--isolated, that is, until the arrival of a young hunter who makes her even more aware of the truth that humans are only an infinitesimal portion in the ecological balance. This truth forms the axis around which the other two narratives revolve: the story of a city girl, entomologist, and new widow and her efforts to find a place for herself; and the story of Garnett Walker and Nannie Rawley, who seem bent on thrashing out the countless intimate lessons of biology as only an irascible traditional farmer and a devotee of organic agriculture can. As Nannie lectures Garnett, "Everything alive is connected to every other by fine, invisible threads. Things you don't see can help you plenty, and things you try to control will often rear back and bite you, and that's the moral of the story." <p> Structurally, that gossamer web <i>is</i> the story: images, phrases, and events link the narratives, and these echoes are rarely obvious, always serendipitous. Kingsolver is one of those authors for whom the terrifying elegance of nature is both aesthetic wonder and source of a fierce and abiding moral vision. She may have inherited Thoreau's mantle, but she piles up riches of her own making, blending her extravagant narrative gift with benevolent concise humor. She treads the line between the sentimental and the glorious like nobody else in American literature. <i>--Kelly Flynn</i></p><p>Barbara Kingsolver's fifth novel is a hymn to wildness that celebrates the prodigal spirit of human nature, and of nature itself. It weaves together three stories of human love within a larger tapestry of lives amid the mountains and farms of southern Appalachia. Over the course of one humid summer, this novel's intriguing protagonists face disparate predicaments but find connections to one another and to the flora and fauna with which they necessarily share a place.</p></p><h2>Passionate Eye</h2><p>An internationally respected composer and performer, Suzanne Vega does not write love songs, per se.

During both world wars he was an adviser to the British treasury, and his theory of government stimulation of the economy through deficit spending influenced Franklin D. Roosevelt&#39;s &#34;New Deal&#34; administration. The mass unemployment caused by the Great Depression inspired his most famous work, General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money (1935-36).Keynes first gained widespread prominence immediately following World War I, when he attended the Versailles peace conference as an economic adviser to British Prime Minister David Lloyd George. Disgusted with the harshly punitive and unrealistic provisions of the Versailles Treaty, as well as the political chicanery and general incompetence of the chief participants, he published The Economic Consequences of the Peace in 1919. This book gained a good deal of notoriety because of its withering portraits of both French premier Georges Clemenceau and U.S. President Woodrow Wilson. Keynes described Clemenceau as motivated only by shortsighted nationalistic goals and vindictiveness, which aimed at crippling Germany for generations no matter what the consequences to the rest of Europe. He found fault with Wilson for his ivory tower idealism, lack of diplomatic savvy, and unfamiliarity with the political realities of Europe. This ineffectual combination ultimately dashed his best hopes for a League of Nations and a just resolution to the war in Europe. In a point-by-point analysis Keynes makes clear the ruinous consequences of the treaty to all of Europe and proposes substantial modifications. Unfortunately, few appreciated Keynes&#39;s prescience, and he saw his worst fears realized in the rise of Hitler and the devastation of World War II.In The End of Laissez-Faire (1926) he presents a brief historical review of laissez-faire economic policy. Though he agrees in principle that a marketplace of free individuals pursuing their own self-interest without government interference has a better chance of improving society&#39;s economic situation than socialist alternatives, he suggests that government can play a constructive role in protecting individuals from the worst harms of capitalism&#39;s cycles, especially as concerns unemployment. Other useful government functions are the dissemination of information relating to business conditions, encouraging savings and investment along &#34;nationally productive channels,&#34; and forming a national policy about the size of population.Keynes&#39;s brilliant mind and lucid writing are evident on every page. Both of these works are still well worth reading for his many stimulating ideas and profound knowledge of economics.</p><p><b>John Maynard Keynes</b> was born in Cambridge, England, on July 5, 1883. His father, John Neville Keynes, was a professor and administrator at Cambridge University and himself the author of <i>The Scope and Methods of Political Economy</i>. After attending Eton (1897&#x2013;1902), Keynes entered King&#x2019;s College, where he studied economics. Following graduation, he worked in the India Office (1906&#x2013;1908); lectured on economics at Cambridge (1908); was made a fellow of King&#x2019;s College (1909), editor of the <i>Economic Journal</i>, and secretary of the Royal Economic Society (1911); and accepted a position in the British treasury.<br><br>In 1919 Keynes was principal representative of the treasury at the Paris Peace Conference. Disturbed by developments at the conference, however, he soon resigned. His <i>Economic Consequences of the Peace&nbsp;</i>(1919) gave voice to his strong objection to the punitive measures being enacted against Germany. In this eloquently argued and strangely prescient work, Keynes detailed the problems that would result from the war reparations to be made by conquered Germany beyond her ability to pay, as well as the devastating economic, social, and political consequences of continuing European ultranationalism.<br><br>Keynes returned to England to resume teaching at Cambridge (1920&#x2013;37), during which time he gave the Sidney Ball Lecture that was published as the pamphlet <i>The End of Laissez-Faire</i> (1926) and wrote his main work, <i>The General Theory of Employment, Interest, and Money&nbsp;</i>(1935&#x2013;36). Critiquing the neoclassical theory of Alfred Marshall, namely, that a normally functioning market&nbsp;<br>economy leads to full employment, Keynes showed that a market economy can operate at less than full employment and that it may even work against reducing unemployment. Keynes advocated enlightened governmental intervention over unregulated laissez-faire policies. The Keynesian analysis of how monetary and financial arrangements affect the economy has formed the basis of subsequent activist governmental fiscal and monetary policy.<br><br>Heart trouble ended Keynes&#x2019;s academic career in 1937. However, he remained active as an adviser to the chancellor of the exchequer (1940) and as principal British delegate and negotiator at the Bretton Woods Conference (1944), Stage II of Lend Lease (1944), arrangements for a United States loan to Britain (1945), and the inauguration of the International Monetary Fund and the International Bank (1946). In 1942, he was raised to the peerage, being named 1st Baron Keynes of Tilton. John Maynard Keynes died in Firle, Sussex, on April 21, 1946. <br><br>Keynes&#x2019;s other published works include<i> A Revision of the Treaty</i> (1922), <i>A Tract on Monetary Reform</i> (1923),<i> A Treatise on Money</i> (1930), and<i> How to Pay for the War</i> (1940).</p><h2>The Story of the Treasure Seekers (The Bastable Series,Virago Modern Classics)</h2><p><p>When their widowed father's business fails, the Bastable children decide to restore the family fortunes themselves.

Travel back in time to join the workers of the Union Pacific Railroad as they pounded west and those from the Central Pacific Railroad as they charged east to build the first transcontinental rail line in the United States. They were racing to meet in Utah, and it was high drama all the way. Workers had to burst through rocky outcrops while hanging in baskets and sleep in tents on top of railroad cars or in barracks buried in snow.<br><br>Bouncy, short verse highlights the steps it took to finally bring the tracks together, and powerful illustrations capture the landscape and the labor.</p><p>Verla Kay lives in Tekoa, Washington. <br><br>Michael McCurdy lives in Great Barrington, Massachusetts.Kay (Gold Fever) tackles another chapter in American history, this time with less success, turning her attention to the building of the transcontinental railroad in the 1860s. Here the rollicking rhyming quatrains that served the theme of the legendary forty-niners so well in Gold Fever are not as effective in relating the history of the railway. From inception ("Railroad barons,/ Visions, dreams./ Thinking, planning,/ Plotting schemes") to completion ("Joined in Utah,/ End of race./ Ceremony,/ Spikes in place"), the events along the way get cursory treatment. Kay's language and meter create an energy that carries the story forward like a briskly chugging engine ("Piercing whistles,/ Shrieking wheels./ Hot steam hissing,/ High-pitched squeals"), but readers may miss the significance of verses like "Survey parties,/ Canvas tents./ Levels, transitsA/ Measurements." McCurdy (The Sailor's Alphabet) fills in many of the gaps with his scratchboard and watercolor illustrations. Their stark beauty has the feeling of old-fashioned woodcuts, their drama heightened by the repetitive use of the color black, which runs through the pages like a visual basso continuo. Whether delineating the peaks of a mountain range, the tall baskets used by Chinese workers to scale stone outcroppings or a trestle bridge crossing a valley, the intricate cross-hatchings and strong linear elements of the artwork echo the ever-expanding line of ties and rails that eventually united East and West.

Concentrates upon the establishment of states by conquest and the peopling of distant countries by immigrants along the peripheries of the European continent. He asks what development in language, law, belief and habit accompanied warfare and settlement, as he explores the formation of racially-mixed societies on the edges of Europe and the ideological justification for aggressive expansion. The theme, however, is not only colonial conquest and settlement, but also the formation of an increasingly homogenous society which, by the end of the Middle Ages, lay poised to enter a yet more expansionary phase of its history - one whose consequences are still around us.</p><p>Robert Bartlett is Professor of Medieval History at St Andrews University<b>One of Choice's Outstanding Academic Titles for 1993</b><br><br>The most stimulating and well-written reassessment of medieval Europe that has appeared for many years.<b>---Eric Christiansen, <i>The New York Review of Books</i></b><br><br><b>One of <i>Choice</i>'s Outstanding Academic Titles for 1993</b><br><br>"The most stimulating and well-written reassessment of medieval Europe that has appeared for many years."<b>--Eric Christiansen, <i>The New York Review of Books</i></b><br><br>Bartlett amasses a wealth of documentation and, unlike other authors, he weaves a rich tapestry of colourful incidents, personalities, and contemporary comment....

Terry was astounded by the transformations that unfolded before his eyes. Soon after, Terry and Kyria started their service dog organization, paws4people, with the goal of pairing dogs with human beings in need of healing, including traumatized and wounded war veterans and children living with physical, emotional, and intellectual disabilities.<br><br>In <i>A Dog's Gift, </i>award-winning journalist and author Bob Drury movingly captures the story of a year in the life of paws4people and the broken bodies and souls the organization mends. The book follows the journey of pups bred by the organization from their loving, if rigorous, early training to an emotional event that terry and Kyria have christened "the bump," where each individual service dog chooses its new owner through an almost mystical connection that ignites the healing process. incorporating vivid storytelling, insights into canine wisdom, history, science, and moving tales of personal transformation, <i>A Dog's Gift </i>is a story of miracles bound to be embraced by not only the 60 million Americans who own dogs, but by anyone with a full heart and a loving soul.</p><p>Bob Drury is a contributing editor at <i>Men's Health </i>and the author, coauthor, and editor of multiple bestselling<i> </i>nonfiction books. He lives in Manasquan, NJ.Chapter One<br><br>Birth<br><br>"Bob! It's time. Get down here."<br><br>There is an urgency to Terry's voice that I've never heard<br><br>Before. I roll out of bed, check my watch, and take the stairs two at a time. It is nearing midnight as I reach the whelping room, sliding across the floor like a cartoon character in my stocking feet. A rumpled Terry is on his knees in the penned-in nursery, cradling Claire's furry head in his arms. He is wearing his trademark uniform of khaki cargo pants, a black T- shirt, and a dark fleece, the clothes creased six ways from Sunday as a result of sleeping on an inflatable air mattress on the floor next to the laboring Golden Retriever.<br><br>"Come on, baby," he whispers in a tone as soft as church music. "That's right. Everything's okay. We've done this before."<br><br>The five-year-old Claire is about to give birth to her third litter of puppies. Although some female dogs can deliver up to the age of seven or eight, Terry and Kyria have decided that this will be Claire's last. Throughout this pregnancy, she has been acting "a little off," in Terry's words. "More jumpy; not eating right."<br><br>Claire is not technically due for another three days. But this afternoon-- day sixty of a dog's typical sixty-three-day gestation period--her temperature dropped from 101 to 98 degrees, and earlier this evening she had ignored a bowl of milk, shredded lamb, and rice that Terry had nudged under her nose. Her lack of appetite worried him, and he sensed that she would drop the pups prematurely.<br><br>Now Terry runs a hand through his salt-and-pepper brush cut as thick as otter fur and glances up at me with a weary smile. "Contractions started," he says. "Kyria's on her way."<br><br>In an adjacent room, a temporary kennel, five curious dogs--three Goldens and two Labs--jostle against the door gate for a better view. Terry and Kyria have only relocated from northern Virginia to their new North Carolina headquarters in the past week--I am their first guest--and parts of the two-story building still resemble a construction site, while the scent of disinfectant fills the entire facility. I follow Terry's gaze as he juts his chin toward a table in the corner piled high with folded quilts and towels, the clean laundry stacked beside a box holding balls of yarn in various colors.<br><br>"If you could hand me a blanket," he says, "and maybe start cutting that yarn into pieces of, oh, twelve inches or so."<br><br>Yarn? The only birth I have ever been present for was my son Liam- Antoine's, fifteen years ago, and I am certain I would recall if there was a need for yarn. We were in a French maternity hospital north of Paris-- Liam-Antoine's mother is French--and I vividly remember the array of gleaming instruments on a table to the side of her birthing bed. The forceps. The medical scissors to snip the umbilical cord. Even the pan in which the placenta would eventually be placed. But no yarn. Terry seems to read my thoughts.<br><br>"When the puppies arrive, we mark their birth order and time. Claire's x- ray showed eight, and things are going to get a little hectic around here. We weigh them and tie a different-colored piece of yarn around each of their necks to remember who's who for the records. I'll need your help keeping track."<br><br>He turns back to Claire and gently urges her to push while he adjusts the two heat lamps on either side of the whelping pen. The joke around paws4people is that Terry loves dogs more than he likes people. Actually, from what I've seen so far, it's really not a joke at all. It is among dogs that I have seen him most relaxed. But Claire is even more special to Terry. A few years back, his beloved Golden Retriever Addie, his own personal psychological Service Dog who helped him cope with his PTSD, died suddenly. Terry was devastated and went into a blue funk. Finally, at Kyria's insistent urgings, he began seeking Addie's successor, and after several starts and stops with potential dogs, he met Claire, with whom he developed a strong bond. Claire was in fact still being trained and groomed as Terry's dog when he noticed the calming effect the dog had on a navy veteran named April Cook.<br><br>April had approached paws4vets seeking help three years earlier, and Terry immediately sensed the emotional connection between her and Claire. When Claire nuzzled and cuddled with her, April visibly relaxed, to the point where she almost seemed a different person. Her old self, maybe. Terry could only guess.<br><br>What he did know was that April had enlisted soon after 9/11 and survived four deployments to Iraq as part of a helicopter medical evacuation and combat search-and-rescue unit. During those tours, she had helped triage scores of wounded and dying American soldiers. April had always thought of herself as an outgoing and vivacious person, curious as to the ways, whys, and wherefores of the world. It was one of the reasons, along with a strong sense of patriotism, that she had joined the navy after high school. Yet following each deployment into combat zones--downrange, as American servicemen and women refer to it--she suspected that her personality was slowly changing.<br><br>"It's hard to explain," she would later tell me. "Like something in my soul was eroding and making me more and more skittish and jumpy and just kinda nuts. I would bawl like a baby at the tiniest things. Losing my hairbrush. A mouse in my tent. I found I wanted to talk to my crew members less and less. I didn't want to hear their stories. I didn't want to know them too well in case they got killed."<br><br>One day, arriving by chopper to tend to the survivors of a firefight outside of Baghdad, her medical crew was ambushed by insurgents. Her helicopter's crew chief pushed her out of the way to safety just as a mortar shell exploded nearby. The crew chief was killed instantly. If not for his actions, it would have been April. This incident was the culmination of a long and debilitating two years. During her earlier deployments, she had been sexually assaulted on multiple occasions by a higher-ranking sailor from her unit. When she reported this to his superior officer, she was threatened with a dishonorable discharge. Those traumas seemed to come to a head after the ambush. She served out her remaining time, received an honorable discharge, and returned home with a severe case of survivor's guilt.<br><br>It was difficult for Terry to part with Claire, but in April he recognized the dog's true soul mate.<br><br>"Maybe there were other dogs that might have pulled April out of her downward spiral," Terry told me. "But I didn't want to take the chance to wait around and find out."<br><br>So last year he placed April's well-being over his own and presented her with Claire. He had only been reunited with Claire last week, when April drove her from her home in Fayetteville and dropped her off so she could give birth at the Wilmington center. Since separating from Claire, April had called the center several times each day to check in on her. What kept April functioning emotionally as she attended therapy classes and lived on her military pension was the knowledge that as soon as Claire's pups were finished suckling, she would return to Fayetteville. On a few occasions, April had even asked Terry or Kyria to put the phone to Claire's ear so she could tell her she loved her.<br><br>Terry could relate to the emotional connection; since placing Claire with April, he had "taken up" (as he puts it) with another beautiful Service Dog, eight-year-old Chaeney, one of the Goldens now in the kennel in the next room. Chaeney had been the feistiest puppy in the second litter paws4people had ever bred, and Terry jokes that he wasn't sure what to do with this "worthless, untrainable" dog until one day, on a whim, he decided to take Chaeney along to an elementary school's special needs classroom that he and Addie were visiting.<br><br>The formerly "worthless" Chaeney blossomed with the children, and he was soon certified as an Educational Assistance Dog with a particular knack for assisting special needs kids prone to violent outbursts. Terry also discovered that when he was with Chaeney, the dog had a soothing influence on his own "black moods." So with Claire gone, Terry turned to Chaeney to be his personal Service Dog, and now he never travels anywhere without him at his side. Yet as much as Terry loves Chaeney, I can see that he still misses his old companion. It is obvious from the way that he now gently massages Claire's distended belly.<br><br>"Her water broke about a half hour ago," he says. "She's been really pushing for twenty or thirty minutes."<br><br>I find scissors and start snipping yarn while Terry, still stroking Claire, begins to tell me his story.<br><br>Terry Henry grew up hopscotching across America's heartland. His father, Jim, a troubleshooting engineer for General Electric, was transferred often, and Terry attended schools in Kentucky, Illinois, and Indiana. It was the Henry home outside of Fort Wayne, Indiana, that he seems to recall with the most fondness--the vast corn fields just across the street that bled into dense woods crisscrossed by creeks. It was in those trees and streams that Terry and the neighborhood kids spent hours constructing forts and building dams. A boy's nirvana.<br><br>Terry was the oldest of two; his mother, Pat, who taught in and later ran nursery schools, would give birth to his sister, Joan, two years later. He was a smart and curious child with good grades, and by the time he reached high school, his interests were myriad, including (in no particular order) girls, sports, the military, and dogs. The first three came naturally, his fascination with soldiers increasing with every television episode of Combat or The Desert Rats and spiking whenever a movie such as The Longest Day arrived at the local theater. The fourth was thrust on him. When he was five years old, his mother took in a Collie from her army-bound cousin, and the pet's care and feeding fell on Terry. It was one way, Jim Henry figured, to teach his son about responsibility. It also had another effect.<br><br>"That's probably when I fell in love with dogs," Terry recalled.<br><br>Except for school, the two went everywhere together; he even brought her to the sandlot and hitched her leash under the stands when he played baseball. When the Collie died of old age, a German Shepherd puppy replaced her in the Henry household, and despite Terry's busy high school agenda, he always made time for her, too. As with the Collie before her, Terry just liked having a dog around, like a good friend.<br><br>Meanwhile, Terry had blossomed into a strong athlete who lettered in football and baseball, but in his senior year his burgeoning career was cut short when he shattered his left arm and shoulder running into an outfield wall. Several surgeries followed, and doctors eventually inserted plates into his shoulder to hold it together. The knowledge that he would never play ball again hurt, but his disappointment was mitigated when the ROTC (Reserve Officers' Training Corps) offered him a full scholarship to pursue an engineering degree at Vanderbilt University, Nashville's venerable "Harvard of the South."<br><br>During his first semester at Vanderbilt, Terry secretly adopted another German Shepherd puppy despite the school's prohibition against pets in the dorms. "I had to hide it, sneaking it in and out the window for walks at night and early in the morning," he said while surreptitiously eyeballing the lengths of yarn I laid out on the table.<br><br>"I thought I was getting away with something until the end of my freshman year, when this guy comes up to me and says, 'I've enjoyed watching you raise your German Shepherd.' Then he identified himself as the dean of students."<br><br>This encounter proved fortuitous. In Terry's sophomore year, he was living off-campus with his pet when one night he and the dog stepped in to prevent some local tough guys from accosting several female students at a mixer. The encounter allowed him to convince the dean of students to form a campus security program, where he got his first taste of what he thought might become a career. Meanwhile, he had also enlisted in the university's naval ROTC program, and he spent his summers training at various military bases throughout the Far East, including a session at the navy's vaunted Philippines Jungle Survival School.<br><br>It was there that a bacterial infection attacked his pericardium, the fibrous sac that surrounds the heart. Terry was flown back to the States and underwent a rare and risky operation to remove his pericardium; he endured yet more surgeries when it was discovered that the bones broken in the old baseball injury had failed to knit properly.<br><br>Despite these physical setbacks, Terry refused to give up on his ROTC commitment, even going so far in his sophomore year as to enroll in a private flight school to earn his pilot's license. It was his aspiration to fly navy fighter jets, but this, too, was to become another dream deferred. For after he graduated with his engineering degree in 1977, navy physicians informed him that the lingering effects of the pericarditis combined with his bum shoulder precluded him from ever piloting a military aircraft. Sympathetic to Terry's disappointment, his unit commander offered him an out--the Department of Defense was cutting back on active-duty numbers across the board in the wake of the Vietnam War, and the officer suggested that, given his medical history, Terry accept the honorable discharge for which he was eligible. And he did just that.<br><br>"They wouldn't let me fly, and I just didn't want to drive ships," he said, dividing his attention between me and Claire and constantly fiddling with the heat lamps. "But ever since the days of watching those war movies, I'd had this longing to be in the military. Plus, they had just paid for my college education, and I felt I owed the government. The other three services were all trimming back, but the air force was still accepting applications. I enlisted and spent the next eight years working in counterintelligence."</p><h2>Dead Voices</h2><p>After her daughter is struck and killed on a desolate highway, Elizabeth begins hearing her child&#39;s voice calling out to her from the grave</p><p></p><h2>Native-American Literature: A Brief Introduction &amp; Anthology</h2><p>Mild shelfwear.

A killer will make sure of that. . . <br><br> <b> Finds It Easier To Kill Again. . .</b><br><br> A 20-year reunion has been scheduled for St. Elizabeth's.

Oversixty of her books have been published and reprinted in more than adozen foreign languages. A single mother, she is a native of Oregon,where she still resides with her two teenage sons.Lisa is often asked what is the key to her success, and her unfailinganswer is a keen imagination, incredible friends, loving family, andalways, loads of laughter. As Oscar Wilde is purported to have said,&#34;Life is too important to be taken seriously.&#34;Despite individual success in the field of suspense, the first collaboration of Jackson (<i>Fatal Burn</i>), Staub (<i>The Final Victim</i>) and Barton (<i>Dangerous Deception</i>) is likely to disappoint their fans. The plot line will ring familiar to slasher movie buffs: a 20-year high school reunion triggers a series of brutal murders committed to avenge an old grievance. In this case, the original sin is the crossbow slaying of popular hunk Jake Marcott, the object of desire for much of the graduating class of Portland, Ore.'s St. Elizabeth's High School, on the night of the St. Valentine's Day Dance. The trauma has become a distant wound for the women who loved him until the 2006 reunion plans spark new killings, and three classmates, Rachel, Kristen and Lindsay, must race to unmask the murderer before they themselves fall victim. Unfortunately, the authors don't do very much to keep the identity of the murderer hidden from the reader, seriously hindering their efforts to wring suspense from the cookie-cutter scenario. <i>(Feb.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Lola Alvarez Bravo explored her calling through photojournalism, commercial work and professional portrait-making, even as she was creating intensely personal images of people, places and things throughout her native Mexico. In addition, she played a vital role in the Mexican cultural scene as an inspiring teacher, a friend of innumerable artists (many of whom she photographed), and as the owner of a prestigious gallery that presented the first solo show by her friend Frida Kahlo, the subject of some of Alvarez Bravo&#39;s most powerful portraits. Although some of her photographs reflect the influence of her husband, Manuel Alvarez Bravo--they shared the same cameras and often the same roll of film--Lola had achieved her own aesthetic by the 1940s and 50s, concentrating on two particularly vivid bodies of work, portraiture and street photography. In these two disciplines she found a way to reveal a lyricism in the world around her, producing quiet reveries on life lived in the moment. This first English-language book to encompass the full range of her work includes previously unpublished images and several of her little-known photomontages.</p><p>Lola Alvarez Bravo This first comprehensive monograph in English for Mexico&#39;s first major woman photographer tracks a career equally exceptional for its remarkable range and for its compelling quality.

Rambachan, who is both a scholar and an Advaitin, attends closely to the Upanisads and authentic commentaries of Sankara to challenge the tradition and to reconsider central aspects of its current teachings.

Questioning Advaita&#x2019;s traditional emphasis on renunciation and world-denial, Rambachan expands the understanding of suffering (duhkha) and liberation (moksa) and addresses socioeconomic as well as gender and caste inequalities. Positing that the world is a celebrative expression of God&#x2019;s fullness, this book advances Advaita as a universal and uninhibited path to a liberated life committed to compassion, equality, and justice.</p><p>In this book, Anantanand Rambachan offers a fresh and detailed perspective on Advaita Vedanta, Hinduism&#x2019;s most influential and revered religious tradition.

Add a hefty dollop of musical nostalgia and a few too many glitzily romantic table settings, and you'll find yourself with a cookbook that may have to fight its way from the coffee table into the kitchen. Two hundred photographs dominate the array of mostly standard international recipes contributed by musical figures, Met administrators and others, from Jenny Lind to Herb Wekselblatt (tuba player in the Metropolitan Opera Orchestra). The pictures of aproned opera greats puttering around the kitchen threaten to take over, but a marvelous campiness prevails, especially in the shots of an elegantly coiffed Anna Moffo kneeling in a chicken coop amid several hundred white hens, and a maniacally grinning Birgit Nillson brandishing garden shears. Recipes are easily prepared and, this being opera territory, hearty. (A notable exception is Caruso's pre-performance favorite, an iceberg lettuce casserole.) The potential for delicious food is here, but the book will appeal mainly to opera-lovers famished for a new kind of vicarious thrill: the pleasure of trying out an idol's treasured recipe. <br>Copyright 1988 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>You Wouldn&#39;t Want to Live Without Vaccinations!</h2><p>Each title in this new series takes readers on a historical journey, examining how people coped in the past and how they developed ingenious ways to make life safer and less unpleasant.

Here in full color are exquisite engravings, gold, silver and platinum inlays, intricately carved mother-of-pearl and ivory--craftsmanship which rivals any other field of decorative arts.For the gun enthusiast, nothing quite catches the eye like an exquisitely engraved and inlaid pistol or long-arm. Wilson, the author of nearly two dozen firearms-related titles, here offers a detailed chronicle of the true art of gun engraving in the United States. Wilson's history actually predates Colonial times, beginning with early English and European attempts at engraving with wheel-locks and flintlocks as far back as the 1500s. Most of the book, however, covers American arms with an emphasis on Colt single-action handguns, Winchester repeating rifles, and monstrous Sharps buffalo guns, with a few knives and swords added for ballast. The text is well detailed and readable, but the main feast here is the hundreds of glorious color photographs. Though the book is expensive, libraries with large hunting/shooting collections won't want to miss this sumptuous volume. Art collections may also wish to consider.

The recipient of the Zenith Pioneer Award from the Alzheimer's Association in 2001, he was formerly the director of the UC Irvine Alzheimer's Disease Clinic and currently runs a community-based program for patients with dementia. <br><br> Daniel G. Amen, M.D., is a clinical neuroscientist, psychiatrist, and the director of three large innovative clinics in California and Washington. He is a nationally recognized expert in the field of the brain and behavior. Among his books are <i>Change Your Brain, Change Your Life</i> and <i>Healing ADD</i>; and he is the coauthor of <i>Healing Anxiety and Depression</i>.The concept of "prevention through delay" as presented by Shankle, a neurologist, and Amen, a psychiatrist, is a proactive approach to thwarting dementia. They break this process down into three components that involve knowing and reducing those risk factors you can control; having a regular memory screening to detect problems early; and obtaining an accurate, early diagnosis and treatment. The authors include their Shankle-Amen Early Dementia Detection Questionnaire as a screening tool to assess risk factors, and follow with discussions on ways to reduce risks and take steps for prevention. Useful tables abound, providing a synopsis of environmental, acquired and modifiable risks for dementia; as well as a review of effective prevention agents. The chapter devoted to finding the right diagnosis offers practical advice on how to get a thorough assessment and drives home the importance of this step by telling readers that 95% of persons with dementia are diagnosed by their primary care doctor four or more years after symptoms first appeared. The authors go on to offer an in-depth approach for patients to work with their doctor to make reversing memory loss "a reality." Although there is plenty of information on treating early dementia, much of it may be too technical for lay readers, and the accompanying photos (showing the brain before and after treatments) do little to elucidate treatment and prevention options. However, an excellent section on resources for caregivers and their families, as well as the aforementioned tables, are extremely helpful. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Their range is diminished, but they&#x2019;re spreading across the West again. Descending into valleys where once they were king, bears find the landscape they&#x2019;d known for eons utterly changed by the new most dominant animal: humans. As the grizzlies approach, the people of the region are wary, at best, of their return.<br> &nbsp;<br> In searing detail, award-winning writer, Montana rancher, and conservationist Bryce Andrews tells us about one such grizzly. Millie is a typical mother: strong, cunning, fiercely protective of her cubs. But raising those cubs&#x2014;a challenging task in the best of times&#x2014;becomes ever harder as the mountains change, the climate warms and people crowd the valleys.

Throughout history, some books have changed the world. They have transformed the way we see ourselves - and each other. They have inspired debate, dissent, war and revolution. They have enlightened, outraged, provoked and comforted. They have enriched lives - and destroyed them. Now Penguin brings you the works of the great thinkers, pioneers, radicals and visionaries whose ideas shook civilization and helped make us who we are.</p><p>Kierkegaard (1813-55) was born in Copenhagen, the youngest of seven children. His childhood was unhappy, clouded by the religious fervour of his father, and the death of his mother, his sisters and two brothers. Educated at the School of Civic Virtue, he went on study theology, liberal arts and science at university, gaining a reputation for his academic brilliance and extravagant social life. He began to criticize Christianity, and in 1841 broke off his engagement to concentrate on his writing. Over the next ten years he produced a flood of works, in particular twelve major philosophical essays, many written under noms de plume. By the end of his life he had become an object of public ridicule, but he is now enjoying increasing acclaim. Alastair Hannay was educated at the Edinburgh Academy, the University of Edinburgh and University College London. In 1961 he became a resident of Norway and is now Emeritus Professor of Philosophy at the University of Oslo.Danish-born S�ren Kierkegaard (1813-55) wrote on a wide variety of themes, including religion, psychology, and literature. He is remembered for his philosophy, which was influential in the development of 20th century existentialism.</p><h2>Picker&#39;s Bible: How To Pick Antiques Like the Pros</h2><p><p><b>The Science of Scrounging</b></p><p>Whether readers are dumpster divers, estate sale addicts or modern archaeologists, this easy-to-use and informative guide to "picking" is guaranteed to improve their antiquing skills. <i>The Picker's Bible</i> provides great tips on where and how to find antiques for the best price.

Trade paperback. (ISBN 0-19-281272-6) Edited by Gerald Roberts. Lovely cover illustration: detail from &#34;Bluebells and other Flowers Growing Round a Tree Stump&#34; by H. Larpent Roberts, Private Collection. Good copy, pages browning, good wrappers. Gerard Manley Hopkins became a Catholic in 1866 at the age of twenty-two and joined the Society of Jesus two years later. It was after this that he wrote the poetry that brought him posthumous fame, but his prose writings, here in Gerald Robert&#39;s fully annotated selection, bring us closer to the man and show the development of his struggle between conflicting vocations. His intelligence was wide-ranging, and he possessed great versatility. In his Journal he expressed his love of nature, often in the subtle, highly unconventional style of his verse, while his sermons vary from graceful eloquence to quaint simplicity. In the letters to his family and friends (starting in 1862, and including many to Robert Bridges), he writes of everyday incidents and contemporary politics, and also of literary matters and his own innovations, among them the development of &#39;sprung rhythm&#39;; but the letters also lay are is intense religious conviction, often urged insistently on his correspondents, and bear witness to the domestic and inner drama of his conversion. The picture that emerges is fascinating and deeply moving: Hopkins was bitterly aware that in emulating his hero, Christ, who &#39;held himself back&#39;, he was deliberately repressing his own genius.

It&#x2019;s thestory of What-the-Dickens, a newly hatched orphan creature who finds he has an attraction to teeth, a crush on a cat named McCavity, and a penchant for getting into trouble. One day he happens upon a feisty girl skibberee working as an Agent of Change &#x2014; trading coins for teeth &#x2014; and learns of a dutiful tribe of tooth fairies to which he hopes to belong. As his tale unfolds, however, both What-the-Dickens and Dinah come to see that the world is both richer and far less sure than they ever imagined.</p><p><b>Gregory Maguire</b>&nbsp;is the author of the incredibly popular books in the Wicked Years series, including&nbsp;<i>Wicked:</i>&nbsp;<i>The Life and Times of the Wicked Witch of the West,&nbsp;</i>which inspired the musical.

Gregory Maguire lives outside Boston.BY EVENING, WHEN THE WINDS ROSE yet again, the power began to stutter at half-strength, and the sirens to fail. From those streetlights whose bulbs hadn't been stoned, a tea-colored dusk settled in uncertain tides. It fell on the dirty militias of pack dogs, all bullying and foaming against one another, and on the palm fronds twitching in the storm gutter, and on the abandoned cars, and everything - everything - was flattened, equalized in the gloom of half-light. Like the subjects in a browning photograph in some antique photo album, only these times weren't antique. They were now. <br><br>The air seemed both oily and dry. If you rubbed your fingers together, a miser imagining a coin, your fingers stuck slightly. <br><br>A fug of smoke lay on the slopes above the deserted freeway. It might have reminded neighbors of campfire hours, but there were few neighbors around to notice. Most of them had gotten out while they still could. <br><br>Dinah could feel that everything was different, without knowing how or why. She wasn't old enough to add up this column of facts: <br><br> - power cuts <br> - the smell of wet earth: mudslide surgically opening the hills <br> - winds like Joshua's army battering the walls of Jericho <br> - massed clouds with poisonous yellow edges <br> - the evacuation of the downslope neighbors, and the silence <br><br>and come up with a grown-up summary, like one or more of the following: <br><br> - the collapse of local government and services <br> - the collapse of public confidence, too <br> - state of emergency <br> - end of the world <br> - business as usual, just a variety of usual not usually seen. <br><br>After all, Dinah was only ten. Ten, and in some ways, a youngish ten, because her family lived remotely. For one thing, they kept themselves apart - literally. The Ormsbys sequestered themselves in a scrappy bungalow perched at the uphill end of the canyon, where the unpaved county road petered out into ridge rubble and scrub pine. <br><br>The Ormsbys weren't rural castaways nor survivalists - nothing like that. They were trying the experiment of living by gospel standards, and they hoped to be surer of their faith tomorrow than they'd been yesterday. <br><br>A decent task and, around here, a lonely one. The Ormsby family made its home a citadel against the alluring nearby world of the Internet, the malls, the cable networks, and other such temptations. <br><br>The Ormsby parents called these attractions slick. They sighed and worried: dangerous. They feared cunning snares and delusions. Dinah Ormsby wished she could study such matters close-up and decide for herself. <br><br>Dinah and her big brother, Zeke, were homeschooled. This, they were frequently reminded, kept them safe, made them strong, and preserved their goodness. Since most of the time they felt safe, strong, and good, they assumed the strategy was working. <br><br>But all kids possess a nervy ability to dismay their parents, and the kids of the Ormsby family were no exception. Dinah saw life as a series of miracles with a fervor that even her devout parents considered unseemly. <br>"No, Santa Claus has no website staffed by underground Nordic trolls. No, there is no flight school for the training of apprentice reindeer. No to Santa Claus, period," her mother always said. "Dinah, honey, don't let your imagination run away with you." Exasperatedly: "Govern yourself!" <br><br>"Think things through," said her dad, ever the peacemaker. "Big heart, big faith: great. But make sure you have a big mind, too. Use the brain God gave you." <br><br>Dinah took no offense, and she did try to think things through. From the Ormsby's bunker, high above the threat of contamination by modern life, she could still love the world. In a hundred ways, a new way every day. Even a crisis could prove thrilling as it unfolded: <br><br> - Where, for instance, had her secret downslope friends gone? Just imagining their adventures on the road - with their normal, middle-class families - made Dinah happy. Or curious, anyway. <br><br> - For another instance: Just now, around the corner of the house, here comes the newcomer, Gage. A distant cousin of Dinah's mom. A few days ago he had arrived on the bus for a rare visit and, presto. When the problems began to multiply and the result was a disaster, Gage had been right there, ready to help out as an emergency babysitter. Talk about timely - it was downright providential. How could you deny it? <br><br>Therefore, Dinah concluded, <br> - A storm is as good a setting for a miracle as any. <br><br>Of course, it would have been a little more miraculous if Gage had proven to be handy in a disaster, but Dinah wasn't inclined to second-guess the hand of God. She would take any blessing that came along. Even if decent cousin Gage was a bit - she tried to face it, to use her good mind with honesty - ineffectual. <br><br>Hopeless at fixing anything. Clumsy with a screwdriver. Skittish with a used diaper. ("As a weather forecaster," Zeke mumbled to Dinah, "Gage is all wet: where is the clear sky, the sunlight he's been promising?") <br><br>Yes, Gage Tavenner was a tangle of recklessly minor talents. Who needed a mandolin player when the electric power wouldn't come on anymore? <br><br>But he was all they had, now. An adequate miracle so far. <br><br>"Zeke," Gage called, "get down from that shed roof! Are you insane? We want another medical crisis?" <br><br>"I was trying to see where the power line was down. . . ." <br><br>"And fry yourself in the process? Power is out all over the county. Up there, if the winds get much stronger, you'll be flown to your next destination without the benefit of an airplane. Down. Now. And Dinah, get Rebecca Ruth off that picnic table before it blows over. I'm going to make another go at jump-starting the generator."</p><h2>Libretto</h2><p>Libretto is a composition of photographs which combines fashion images, still life, and nudes. As if in a fairy tale, the combination of these elements forms a magic and enchanted world of shade and light, shapes and colors, an atmosphere both dreamlike and bewitching. The emotion of a look, the sensuality of a body, the elegance of a movement-together they lead us into the mysterious spheres of beauty. As Paolo Roversi puts it himself: &#34;This small book has emerged coincidentally, without particular reason. One has to take it, the way one picks up a stone, the way one hears a song or a bird twittering down in the garden.&#34;</p><p></p><h2>Song of Kali</h2><p>Robert Luczak, sent to Calcutta to interview the mysterious poet M. Das, who has been missing for ten years, discovers that the missing man is mixed up in the death-worshipping cult of Kali</p><p>"O terrible wife of Siva / Your tongue is drinking the blood, / O dark Mother! O unclad Mother." It is remarkable that prior to writing this first novel, Dan Simmons had spent only two and a half days in Calcutta, a city "too wicked to be suffered," his narrator says. Fortunately back in print after several years during which it was hard to obtain, this rich, bizarre novel practically reeks with atmosphere. The story concerns an American poet who travels with his Indian wife and their baby to Calcutta to pick up an epic poem cycle about the goddess Kali. The Bengali poet who wrote the poem cycle has disappeared under mysterious circumstances.<p>Horror critic Edward Bryant calls <i>Song of Kali</i> "an exactingly constructed, brutal, and uncompromising study of the degree to which an evil place may permeate and steep all that makes us human" and writes that it embodies "the stance of a psychologically violent novel about a violent society as a defensible and indisputably moral work of art." <i>Song of Kali</i> won a World Fantasy Award. <i>--Fiona Webster</i></p><p><b>Dan Simmons</b> is a recipient of numerous major international awards, including the Hugo Award, World Fantasy Awards, Bram Stoker Awards, and the Shirley Jackson Award. He is widely considered to be one of the premier multiple-genre fiction writers in the world. His novels include the<i> New York Times</i> bestseller<i> The Terror, Drood</i>, and <i>Black Hills</i>. He lives along the Front Range in Colorado and has never grown tired of the views.</p></p><h2>Christopher Columbus: A Man Among the Gentiles</h2><p>Over the centuries, the story of Christopher Columbus has become so enshrouded in myth that his life has remained largely a mystery to all but a handful of scholars. Yet the prophet Nephi suggests that Columbus stands out among historical figures as &#34;a man among the Gentiles.&#34; In fact, Lehi and Nephi identify only two specific individuals in their prophecy of the latter-day Restoration: Christopher Columbus and Joseph Smith. In a sense, these two men stand as bookends to the Restoration one at the beginning and one at the end. Columbus himself wrote that he was inspired by the Holy Ghost to undertake his voyage a claim which some historians struggle to accept. In this candid and revealing treatment, author Clark B. Hinckley uncovers a man with two great dreams. Yet what may be the most remarkable aspect of Columbus&#39;s life is the degree to which he understood his prophetic mission and his place in history.</p><p>Clark B. Hinckley became interested in the life of Christopher Columbus while serving as president of the Spain Barcelona Mission. His research led him to archives in Seville, Simancas, and Madrid, where he was able to read and study some of the original writings of Columbus. A former senior vice president at Zions Bank, the author earned a bachelor s degree in mathematics from BYU and an MBA from Harvard University.</p><h2>Planning for Coastal Resilience: Best Practices for Calamitous Times</h2><p>Climate change is predicted to increase the frequency and magnitude of coastal storms around the globe, and the anticipated rise of sea levels will have enormous impact on fragile and vulnerable coastal regions. In the U.S., more than 50% of the population inhabits coastal areas. In <i>Planning for Coastal Resilience</i>, Tim Beatley argues that, in the face of such threats, all future coastal planning and management must reflect a commitment to the concept of resilience. In this timely book, he writes that coastal resilience must become the primary design and planning principle to guide all future development and all future infrastructure decisions.&nbsp;Resilience, Beatley explains, is a profoundly new way of viewing coastal infrastructure&#x2015;an approach that values smaller, decentralized kinds of energy, water, and transport more suited to the serious physical conditions coastal communities will likely face. Implicit in the notion is an emphasis on taking steps to build adaptive capacity, to be ready ahead of a crisis or disaster. It is anticipatory, conscious, and intentional in its outlook. &nbsp;After defining and explaining coastal resilience, Beatley focuses on what it means in practice. Resilience goes beyond reactive steps to prevent or handle a disaster. It takes a holistic approach to what makes a community resilient, including such factors as social capital and sense of place. Beatley provides case studies of five U.S. coastal communities, and &#x201c;resilience profiles&#x201d; of six North American communities, to suggest best practices and to propose guidelines for increasing resilience in threatened communities.</p><p>Timothy Beatley is Teresa Heinz Professor of Sustainable Communities at the<br>University of Virginia. His books include <i>Green Urbanism Down Under</i> (Island Press, 2008) and <i>Resilient Cities</i> (Island Press, 2008).&nbsp;The work described in this book was commissioned and supported by the<br>Coastal Services Center of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Headquartered in Charleston, South Carolina, its mission is to foster and sustain the environmental and economic well-being of the nation&#x2019;s coasts by linking people, information, and technology."Tim Beatley scouts the frontiers of sustainable development, bringing back examples of progressive practice from the field. He provides a clear-eyed look at emerging efforts by coastal planners struggling to prepare their communities to cope with forecasts of potentially catastrophic impacts of climate change and sea level rise." <br> (David R. Godschalk <i>FAICP, Emeritus Planning Professor, University of North Carolina</i>)<br><br>"In this very timely volume, Tim Beatley points out the profound changes that will soon occur along our coasts including sea level rise and increased intensity of storms. In response to these threats, Beatley argues that the principles of coastal resilience afford the way to a sound coastal management future. Case studies and specific examples of resilience approaches make this book a critical addition to the library of anyone concerned with the future of the world's coasts." <br> (Dr. Orrin H. Pilkey <i>James B. Duke Professor Emeritus, Nicholas School of the Environment</i>)<br><br>"This is the first book to span the range of issues from socioeconomic vulnerability to green technologies facing coastal managers and planners. Tim Beatley, one of the foremost coastal hazard planners, provides guidelines, a checklist for action, and an overall vision for planning for coastal resilience and climate change. Coastal communities face unprecedented challenges and a possible calamitous future; this is what this book hopes to prevent." <br> (Stephen P. Leatherman <i>Director, The Laboratory for Coastal Research, Florida International University</i>)</p><h2>The Sentinel (Masterworks of Science Fiction and Fantasy)</h2><p>A collection of short science fiction stories portrays the strange adventures of the explorers of outer space</p><p>Originally published in 1983, the "2001 Anniversary Edition" of Arthur C. Clarke's <i>The Sentinel</i> offers insight and commentary on 10 of Clarke's most notable short stories.<p> In Clarke's introduction, he explores why he became the kind of writer he did, and he offers a look at the very first paragraph he ever published--in 1933. This anthology spans three decades, beginning in 1946 with the second story he published, "The Rescue Party," and offers a chance to read some of the short stories that later germinated into his most spectacular works.</p><p> It's a special treat to be able to see the beginnings of <i>2001: A Space Odyssey</i> and <i>Childhood's End</i>, along with Clarke's thoughts on how each story came about. The truly amazing thing is that Clarke's short fiction still holds up, by and large. It's unavoidable that time would catch up with Clarke, though. In fact, he almost apologetically reminds the reader that while "Jupiter V" is dated, Sputnik was still six years in the future when it was written in 1951.</p><p> While it would have been wonderful if Clarke had added an additional introduction about the human race's journey into 2001 and beyond for this special edition, that was not to be. His most recent words in this anthology were written in 1983. But that's a minor quibble. With exceptional illustrations by Lebbeus Woods, <i>The Sentinel</i> is a must-read, not only for Clarke fans, but for all readers of science fiction. <i>--Kathie Huddleston</i></p>Few masters of science fiction have brought us glimpses of the near future as vividly as Arthur C. Clarke. It is the startling realism of his vision that has made classics of his Childhood's End and 2001: A Space Odyssey -- and Clarke himself one of the genre's most successful writers.<p>To commemorate the fast-approaching arrival of one of the most notable dates in science fiction history comes this special anniversary edition of The Sentinel, a brilliant collection of Clarke's highest caliber short fiction. Among the ten stories included in this volume are: </p><p>"The Sentinel": The story that inspired 2001: A Space Odyssey, one of the most famous SF movies of all time</p><p>"Guardian Angel": The rarely-glimpsed work that gave birth to Childhood's End</p><p>"The Songs of Distant Earth": A fantastic tale of first contact with an alien world, which became the basis for one of Clarke's most successful novels</p><p>"Breaking Strain": The inspiration for the popular book series Arthur C. Clarke's Venus Prime</p></p><h2>Astrology and Your Health</h2><p>Describes the particular health traits associated with each sign of the zodiac, tells how to read an aura for emotional balancing, and discusses dream analysis, crystal therapy, and visualization</p><p>JEANNE AVERY is a world-renowned astrologer and regression therapist who has lectured throughout the U.S., Europe, and South America.

A New York Times bestselling author and voted one of the top ten romance writers in America, she has a gift for telling the most sensual tales with charm and humor. Diana lives with her family in Cornelia, Georgia.<br><br>THE OLD JACOBS PLACE was in disrepair. The last owner hadn't been big on maintenance, and now there was a leak in Garon's study. Right over his damned computer, in fact.<br><br>He glared at it from the doorway, elegantly dressed in a gray suit. He'd just arrived in Jacobsville from Washington, D.C., where he'd been taking a course at Quantico on homicide investigation. It was his new specialty, that area of law enforcement. Garon Grier was a career FBI man. He worked out of the San Antonio office, but he'd recently moved from an apartment there to this huge ranch in Jacobsville. His brother Cash was the Jacobsville police chief. The brothers had been alienated for some time. Cash had disowned his family over his father's remarriage just days after his beloved mother's death from cancer. That long feud had only just ended. Cash was newly, happily, married to Tippy Moore, the "Georgia Fire-fly" of modeling and motion picture fame. She had just had their first child, a little girl.<br><br>Cash thought the child was the crown jewels. To Garon, she looked more like a little red prune with flailing fists. But as the days passed, she did seem to grow prettier. Garon loved children. No one would ever have guessed it. He had a demeanor that was blunt and confrontational. He rarely smiled, and he was usually all business, even with women. Especially with women. He'd lost his one true love to cancer. It had eaten the heart out of him. Now, at thirty-six, he was resigned to being alone for the rest of his life. It was just as well, he decided, because he had nothing to give to a woman. He lived for his job. He would have liked a child of his own, though. A little boy would be nice. But he had no desire to risk his heart in pursuit of one.<br><br>Miss Jane Turner, the housekeeper he'd hired, came into the room behind him, her thin face resigned. "There aren't any construction people available until next week, Mr. Garon," she said in her Texas drawl. "We'd best put a bucket under it for now, I reckon, unless you want to climb up on the roof with a hammer and nails."<br><br>He gave her a superior look. "I don't climb up on roofs," he said flatly.<br><br>She looked him over in the suit."That doesn't surprise me," she muttered, turning to go.<br><br>He gave her a shocked look.She must think he never wore anything but suits, when he'd grown up on a sprawling west Texas ranch. He could ride anything with four legs, and he'd won prizes in rodeo competitions in his teens. Now, he knew more about guns and investigation than he did about rodeo,but he could still run a ranch. In fact, he was stocking purebred black Angus cattle here,and he planned to give his father and brothers a run for their money in cattle shows. He had in mind founding his own champion herd sires here. If he could lick the problem of getting qualified cowboys to work for an outsider, that was. Small towns seemed to draw into themselves when people from other places moved in. Jacobsville had less than two thousand people living in it, and most of them seemed to watch Garon from behind curtained windows every time he walked around town. He was surveyed, measured up and kept carefully at a distance for the time being. People in Jacobsville were particular about letting strangers join the family, because that was what they considered themselves&#x2014;a family of two thousand souls.<br><br>He glanced at his watch. He was already late for a meeting with his squad of agents at the San Antonio FBI office, but last night his flight had been unexpectedly delayed in D.C. by a security hitch. It was early morning before the plane landed in San Antonio. He'd had to drive down to Jacobsville, and he'd barely slept. He walked out onto the wide, concrete front porch with its gray floor and white porch swing and white wicker furniture and cushions. Those were new. It was late February, and his housekeeper said they needed someplace for his company to sit when it came. He told her he wasn't expecting to have any. She snorted and ordered the furniture anyway. She was an authority on everybody who lived around here. She'd probably become an authority on him in short time, but he'd told her graphically what would happen if she dared to pass on any personal gossip about his life. She'd just smiled. He hated that damned smile. If he could have gotten any other spinster lady with her cooking skills to work for him...<br><br>He glanced at an old, black car of unknown vintage coughing smoke as it went slowly down the road. That would be the next-door neighbor, whose little green-trimmed white clapboard house was barely visible through the pecan and mesquite trees that separated his big property from her small one. Her name was Grace Carver. She took care of her elderly grandmother, who had a serious heart condition. The granddaughter wasn't much to look at. She wore her blond hair in a long pigtail, and went around mostly in loose jeans and a sweatshirt. She was shy around Garon. In fact, she seemed to be afraid of him, which was curious. Maybe his reputation had gotten around.<br><br>He'd met her when her old German shepherd dog trespassed into his yard. He'd escaped his fenced pen and she came looking for him, apologizing profusely the whole time. She had green eyes, very pale, and an oval face. She was plain, except for her pretty mouth and exquisite complexion. She'd only stayed long enough to make her apologies and introduce herself. She hadn't come close enough to shake hands, and she'd left as soon as she could, almost dragging the delinquent dog behind her. She hadn't been back since. Miss Jane had mentioned a week or so later that the old dog had died. Old Mrs. Collier, Grace's grandmother, didn't like dogs anyway. Garon remarked that Miss Carver had been nervous around him. Miss Turner told him that Grace was "peculiar" about men. God knew what that meant.<br><br>Miss Jane also said that Grace didn't get out much. She didn't elaborate. He didn't ask anything else about her. He wasn't interested. He liked an occasional night out with an attractive woman, preferably a modern, educated one. Miss Carver was the sort of woman he'd never found interesting.<br><br>He checked his watch, closed the front door and climbed into his black Bucar for the drive to San Antonio. He was entitled to use a Bucar&#x2014;the FBI's term for a bureau conveyance&#x2014;even though a new black Jaguar sat in the garage next to his big Ford Expedition. He carried all his gear and accessories in the Bucar. So he drove it to work. It was going to be something of a commute, but no more than twenty minutes either way. Besides, he was tired of apartment living. Miss Turner was astringent, but she was a hell of a good cook, and she kept house without talking his ear off. He considered himself fortunate.<br><br>He set off down the driveway, casting a curious glance after Grace's choking engine. He wondered if she knew that her car had a mechanical problem, and reasoned that she probably didn't. He glimpsed her from time to time mulching and pruning her roses. She had several bushes of them. That was one thing they did have in common. He loved roses, and during his brief marriage, he'd grown several varieties. It was a hobby he enjoyed,and he had plenty of room to practice it again here at the ranch. Of course, it was February. Not many roses would bloom this time of year.<br><br>THE OFFICE WAS BUZZING when he got there. A local homicide detective with San Antonio P.D. was waiting for him, in his office.<br><br>"I haven't even had time to brief the SAC about the workshop, yet," Garon muttered to the secretary he shared with another agent. "What's he want?" he added, nodding toward the tall, dark-headed man standing at the window with his hands in his pockets and his black hair in a long ponytail, even longer than the one Garon's brother Cash, wore. It designated a renegade.<br><br>"Something about an abducted child case he's working on."<br><br>"I don't do missing person cases unless they end as homicides," he reminded her.<br><br>She gave him a knowing look. "I work here," she pointed out. "I know what you do."<br><br>He glared at her. "Don't get smart." <br><br>"Don't get snippy," she shot back."I could be making twenty dollars an hour as a plumber."<br><br>"Joceline, you can't even put a washer in a faucet," he replied patiently. "Or don't you remember what happened when you tried to fix the leaky one in the women's restroom?"<br><br>She pushed back her short, dark hair. "The floor needed mopping anyway," she told him haughtily. "Now, if you want to know what Detective Marquez wants, why don't you go and ask him?"<br><br>He sighed irritably."Okay. How about a cup of coffee?"<br><br>"Already had one, thanks," she said. She gave him a smile.<br><br>"I hate liberated women," he grumbled.<br><br>"Gee, can't you lift a coffee cup all by yourself?" she asked with mock surprise. <br><br>"When you come asking for a raise, see what happens," he said.<br><br>"When you want a case report typed, see what happens," was the smug reply.<br><br>He muttered in gutter Spanish all the way into his office. He hoped Joceline understood every single nasty word. But if she did, she didn't let on.<br><br>The detective heard his footsteps and turned. He had black eyes and an olive complexion, and a worried expression.<br><br>"I'm Marquez," he introduced himself, shaking hands. "You'd be Special Agent Grier, I assume?"<br><br>"If I'm not, I don't have to look at all that paperwork piled on my desk," Garon replied dryly."Have a seat. Like a cup of coffee?" he added, then grimaced. "We'll have to go get it ourselves, of course, because my secretary is a liberated woman!" he raised his voice as she went past the door.<br><br>"The computer is about to eat your six-page letter to the attorney general about your proposed new legislation," she called merrily. "Sorry, but I'm sure you can draft a new one..."<br><br>"If you ever get married, I'll give you away!"<br><br>"If I ever get married, I'll give you away," she retorted and kept walking.<br><br>He sat down behind his desk with a rough sound in his throat. "She and my housekeeper must be sisters," he told the visitor. "I hired them and they tell mewhat to do."<br><br>Marquez only smiled. "I was told that you head a squad that deals with violent crimes against children," he said.<br><br>Garon leaned back in his chair, and all the humor went out of his face. "Technically I head a squad that deals with violent crime, up to and including serial murder. I've never worked child murders."<br><br>Marquez frowned. "Then who does?" <br><br>"Special Agent Trent Jones was our crimes against children specialist," he replied."But he just got transferred back to Quantico to work on a high profile case. We haven't had time to replace him." He frowned. "I thought Joceline said you had a missing person case?"<br><br>Marquez nodded. He looked as solemn as Garon did. "It started out as a missing person case. Now it's a homicide; a ten-year-old girl," he said quietly. "We've checked out everyone close to her, including both parents, and we can't turn a perpetrator. Now we think it might have been a stranger."<br><br>This was serious business. The news had been full of abducted children who were murdered by convicted sex offenders, all over the country. The case was, sadly, not that unique.<br><br>"Do you have any leads?"<br><br>Marquez shook his head. "We only found the body yesterday. That's why I'm here. I found a similar case. I think it's a serial crime. That means I can ask you for help."<br><br>Garon leaned back in his chair. "When was she abducted?"<br><br>"Three days ago," Marquez said quietly.<br><br>"Any latents at the scene?" Garon asked.<br><br>"No, and we had the criminologists on their hands and knees all over her bedroom with blue lights. Nothing. Not a single latent fingerprint."<br><br>"He took her out of her bedroom?" he asked, surprised.<br><br>"In the middle of the night, and nobody heard anything," Marquez replied.<br><br>"Footprints, tire tracks...?"<br><br>Marquez shook his head. "Either this guy is very lucky, or..."<br><br>"...or he's done this before," Garon finished for him.<br><br>Marquez drew in a long breath. "Exactly. Of course, my lieutenant doesn't buy that. He thinks we've got a pedophile who carried the kid away and killed her.I told him that this is the second case of bedroom abduction we've seen in the past two years. The last one was over in Palo Verde,and the child was murdered in a similar manner. I found it listed on VICAP, the FBI's violent criminal apprehension program. I showed it to the lieutenant. He told me I was chasing ghosts."<br><br></p><h2>A Bear Called Paddington (BCP Latin Texts) (Latin Edition)</h2><p>Paddington Bear at last joins Winnie the Pooh and Peter Rabbit in having his well known and well loved adventures turned into Latin. Who can resist learning the Latin for &#39;marmalade sandwiches&#39; and &#39;Darkest Peru&#39;?</p><p>Mr. and Mrs. Brown first met Paddington--a most endearing bear from Darkest Peru--on a railway platform in London. A sign hanging around his neck said, "Please look after this bear. Thank you" So that is just what they did.<p></p><p>From the very first night when he attempted his first bath and ended up nearly flooding the house, Paddington was seldom far from imminent disaster. Jonathan and Judy were delighted with this havoc and even Mr. and Mrs. Brown had to admit that life seemed to be more filled with adventure when there was a bear in the house.</p>I wrote my first children's book in 1957 and it came about largely by accident. At that time I had been a part-time writer for about ten years, following a common progression in those days: short stories, newspaper and magazine articles, radio plays, plus a few short plays for television, I thought it was a good year if I sold one piece in ten. <p>Without giving the matter any great thought, I had always regarded writing for children as a lesser form of creativity-quite untrue, of course. As Gertrude Stein might have said-a book is a book is a book, and writing is perhaps even more of an agonizing process of distillation when it's for children. </p><p>There being nothing more soul-destroying than staring at a blank sheet of paper hoping something will happen (it won't unless you make it), I was sitting at the typewriter one morning when my gaze happened to alight on a toy bear I had bought my wife for Christmas. We called him Paddington, so I typed the words: "Mr and Mrs. Brown first met Paddington on a railway platform. In fact that was how he came to have such an unusual name for a bear, for Paddington was the name of the station." </p><p>Suddenly, I wanted to write more about this small character. Where had he come from? What was he doing in London? What were his reactions to life in England and the curious complications we humans make for ourselves? </p><p>Until that time I had always thought up stories and then tried to people them with characters. Suddenly, I learned a very simple fact of fictional life. If you create a believable character and you place it into a situation, events will develop naturally of their own accord. </p><p>Many of my radio and television plays had been light comedies which more often than not were returned with the comment "Sorry-no call for fantasy" written across the rejection slip. Nonsense, of course: All works of fiction are fantasy, and nothing could be more so than the concept of a bear with a penchant for marmalade sandwiches, who lives in Notting Hill Gate and speaks perfectly good English. But until then, I hadn't learned the trick of making it seem believable. That won't happen unless both you, the writer, and the characters in the story believe in it, too. </p><p>I wrote the first chapter very quickly, instinctively putting in all the things I felt I would have wanted as a child. More followed, and in ten days I had a finished book. </p><p>In retrospect, some thirty-five years and many books later, I think most fictional characters who enjoy longevity do so because someone, somewhere, at some time wrote about them for the very simple reason that they wanted to. </p><p>The first book of any series is the most fun to write; everything is fresh and exciting, and you can go anywhere your fancy takes you. Recapturing the original mood in subsequent books isn't always easy. Parameters have been set which dictate future stories; what the characters can and can't do. Paddington has the best of all worlds; he combines the naivet of a small child with the sophistication of an adult, plus ingredient "X"-his own peculiar brand of logic. Being a bear, he gets away with things without seeming precocious. The stories wouldn't work were he a small child. </p><p>Children hate being written down to or made to feel they are being patronized. They like their heroes to come out on top and the feeling of comfort that goes with a safe return to base or the comfort of a home. They also-quite rightly-dislike being sold short. </p><p>I hold the old-fashioned view that stories should have a beginning, a middle, and an end, and the hardest part with Paddington is not getting him into trouble-he does this of his own accord-but getting him out of it in a way which is morally justifiable; someone must always benefit from his misdeeds however tenuously. </p><p>If fiction does nothing else, it provides a window on the world; perhaps showing things from a different viewpoint; even if-as in the case of another series I write about a guinea-pig called Olga da Polga-that window happens to be part of a hutch. </p><p>I once received a letter from a child who said she liked my books because they made pictures in her head. It was the nicest compliment I've ever had.</p></p><h2>In the Beginning Was Information</h2><p>Used. Very Good conditions.

Their abstract compositions fascinated artists of all disciplines.<br><br>This striking affinity is at the core of this publication, which concisely contrasts Moroccan woven and knotted carpets with European as well as American twentieth-century painting. The abstract debate with graphic fundamental elements, such as point, line and surface is the unifying element with early so-called primitive cultures of Africa, Asia and the Americas and of Western avant-garde artists. With a clear and enriching glimpse into the spiritual connections and the cultural exchanges between East and West, the publication illustrates how the abandonment of figural representations in the Islamic world led to reactions and outcomes very similar to the abstract art of the occident.<br><br>Text in English and German.</p><p>With over 700 gloriously printed color illustrations, this hefty over-sized tome sports an embossed linen cover, and a consistently insightful commentary. (Norman Weinstein <i>Designers &amp; Books</i>)</p><h2>St Petersburg: A Cultural History</h2><p>A compelling portrait of a city and its transcendent artistic and spiritual legacy-written by a cultural historian who has known some of the greatest figures of modern St. Petersburg, including Balanchine, Shostakovich, Akhmatova, and Brodsky. &#34;A rich and enjoyable work&#34;. -&#34;The Economist&#34;. of photos.</p><p>St Petersburg is one of the world?s most beautiful cities. Most of its baroque and neoclassical palaces and churches are modelled on those of Italy and France, in turn inspired by the temples of classical Greek and Rome. Yet it is situated on a swamp, a location so insalubrious that it took the lives of the thousands who built the city. Founded by Peter the Great on land seized from Sweden in 1703, the Tsar made it into his new capital and Russia?s gateway to Europe. Guarded by the Kronstadt Fortress, it was never conquered and under his successors the city achieved a splendour and cultural richness that vied with other European capitals. After the Golden Age of the 1830s when Pushkin and Lermontov wrote some of Russia?s greatest literature, famine and war would undermine political and cultural life, and the Revolution led to calamity. Nonetheless, in the dying embers of the old regime, music, art and theatre all thrived, creating a Silver Age which brought the city renewed renown. During the Soviet period, the city, renamed Leningrad, fell into a Cinderella-like slumber, with Moscow taking primacy. Yet it survived both wars to enjoy a revival after the fall of the Soviet Union under its old name. Neil Kent considers the extraordinary history of St Petersburg along with its political, religious, cultural and social dimensions, rich in stories and anecdotes from its various periods. Its musical heritage is unrivalled: Mussorgsky, Rimsky-Korsakov, Tchaikovsky and Rachmaninov are all associated with the city. A walk today through the streets and courtyards evokes the world of Dostoyevsky who immortalized its violent underbelly in his 1865 novel Crime and Punishment. He turned to Orthodoxy for inspiration, as does the modern city today. This revival has been multifaceted, its pictorial glories on display in the Russian Museum and Hermitage Gallery. As Kent stresses, St Petersburg remains a city of paradox, full of tragedy but also of breathtaking beauty and endurance.Volkov was born in Russia and studies violin at the Leningrad Conservatory, receiving his diploma with honors.

By the author of Drive Me Crazy and Thieves&#39; Paradise.</p><p>ERIC JEROME DICKEY is the<i> New York Times</i> bestselling author of more than twenty novels, as well as a six-issue miniseries of graphic novels featuring Storm (<i>X-Men</i>) and the Black Panther. Originally from Memphis, Dickey now lives on the road and rests in whatever hotel will have him.How does an affair begin? <p> I think that mine, like most, started unintentionally. Married or not, it was my first transgression. I�m not malicious, that is not in my nature, hurting someone I love, that is. </p><p> My wife. Genevieve. </p><p> She is thirty-two. Has been turning thirty-two over and over for the last five years. </p><p> Her name has been Genevieve since she turned twenty-one, the day she marched to court and rid herself of the name her mother had given her. In her eyes her birth name was too urban. Too Alabama. A reminder that her ancestors had been slaves and that her family still lived in chains, some physically, some metaphorically, some in the psychological sense. </p><p> She is not one of them. Not cut from the cloth of people who name their children after cars and perfumes and possessions they cannot afford, or have a home filled with bastard children, each of those bastard children named after drugs the parents were addicted to at the time. She is not one of the people who took a simple name and bastardized its simplistic spelling to the point that it looked ridiculous on paper and sounded ludicrous as it rolled off the tongue, then pretended the name was that of an unknown king or queen, its origin rooted in Mother Africa. </p><p> She is Genevieve. </p><p> Genevieve. </p><p> She loves her name because to her ear, when spoken correctly, Genevieve sounds intellectual. Not Gen. Not Vee. Not any other variation. She will only respond to her name in total, Genevieve. And she is particular about that. She frowns on the Americanized pronunciation, �JEH-neh-veev.� She prefers the elegant-in-tone French version, �ZHAWN-vee-EHV.� She will answer to both, but only the French version is accompanied with a smile. </p><p> She is a precise woman. She is not five-foot-one; she is five-foot-one-and-one-quarter. I suppose, to a woman, a quarter of an inch could be the difference between pleasure and a night of frustration. </p><p> She has come up from poverty and, once again I state, has declared herself an intellectual. Not one that has stumbled out of the womb and continues to stumble through life without meaning or purpose. Not one of the problem children Bill Cosby rants about. She has endless goals. My wife is a planner. A degreed woman who knows what she will be doing for the next twenty years. She has it mapped out, literally. </p><p> She says that when she was a teenager, she mapped her escape from a small town called Odenville, from her past, drew a road to her future. </p><p> She did that the day her father murdered her mother. Cut her throat. She told me that her mother was a woman who had many lovers. Her father was a man who grew tired of being ridiculed in his small town. A man who lost it, then called the police, and sat waiting for them to come take him away, tears in his eyes, his dead wife in his arms being rocked and sung to, his every word telling her how much he loved her, how she had made him do something bad. </p><p> No matter how I have tried, Genevieve refuses to let me into her past. That leaves me feeling shut out in that part of her life. She only gives me part of herself. Thus, my needs are beyond those of the loins. My need is to feel complete. To not have this glass wall between us. </p><p> Genevieve�s desires are flowcharted, every move thought out like a chess player willing to sacrifice her queen in order to slay her opponent�s king. Every move from Odenville to undergrad at Spelman to grad school at UCLA to PhD from Pepperdine University in Malibu, everything that she has accomplished or plans to accomplish is on poster-sized, light-green engineering grid paper, laminated and framed, hung at eye level on the west wall in her office, facing due east. Like a prayer. Her ambitions hang on the wall facing east for another reason as well. That way her map to total domination of the free world will be brought to life and highlighted with every sunrise. </p><p> The light of my life, the fire in my loins. </p><p> Doctor Genevieve Forbes. </p><p> When we married, she kept her last name, the one she had decided would be hers from the first time she picked up a magazine with that title, the new one that sang of richness and power and old money, the name she crowned herself with. </p><p> Genevieve. </p><p> Not Gen. Not Vee. Not �JEH-neh-veev.� </p><p> Genevieve. �ZHAWN-vee-EHV.� </p><p> Write her name in soft italics; cross the ocean and learn to speak it in its native language. Let it roll off the tongue. Allow it to melt like warm butter. </p><p> Genevieve. </p><p> I love her because she is an intellectual. Brilliance is an aphrodisiac. </p><p> I despise her for the same reason.</p></p><h2>The River Why</h2><p>[Read by Dick Hill]<br><br>The classic novel of fly fishing and spirituality republished with a new Afterword by the author.<br><br>Since its publication in 1983, <b><i>The River Why</i></b> has become a classic.

From a wealthy family with a military history, he admired the struggle for independence in the American colonies and crossed the Atlantic Ocean to fight on the side of the colonists. Readers will learn how he became a longtime friend of the future president, George Washington, and how his skills both on the battlefield and in persuading the government of France to support the American colonists, earned him a lasting legacy in the history of the United States.</p><p>Gr 4-8-By examining people closely involved in the American Revolution, these titles go beyond accounts of battles to probe the social and philosophical underpinnings of the conflict. Although many libraries will have individual biographies of these four figures, looking at their lives as they converged during the Revolutionary period does offer a focused and unique point of view. The format of the books makes them easy to read and digest. Paragraphs are spaced out, with subheadings over each chunk of text. The narratives are interspersed with images, which include historical drawings, paintings, engravings, and maps, as well as some contemporary photographs of monuments and locations. The authors state what is verifiable and note when historical accounts disagree. Sidebar questions in "What Do You Think?" boxes encourage readers to come up with their own ideas, especially about areas where historians must use conjecture. "What Do You Know?" boxes define terms used in the text that may be unfamiliar to some readers. Time lines, major-events lists, and "People at the Time" boxes also give readers extra support in understanding the context of the period. The research presented is not new, but libraries with a strong demand for this subject area will appreciate these series titles' fresh approach and format.-Lucinda Snyder Whitehurst, St. Christopher's School, Richmond, VA&#x3b1;(c) Copyright 2013.

Jill and Leon Uris came to Ireland looking for answers. Why has Ireland been bled by one internal war after another? How can one country contain such greatness and grief? What they discovered was more than the Ireland of peat fires and pubs, of fabled Irish wit and the haunts of the banshees. What they found was a people-trapped in mutual mistrust, but with a courage and kindness that brought them through centuries of bitter occupation and civil dissension, in a land as complexly beautiful as the people themselves. This then in words-and in poetic and powerful photographs-is the Urises&#39; &#34;love song&#34; to the Irish and to Ireland.</p><p></p><h2>Milton and the English Revolution</h2><p>Examines every important aspect of Milton&#39;s life and of his work as poet, politician, and religious thinker, relating his actions and ideas to those of his contemporaries</p><p></p><h2>Vegas Sunrise</h2><p>Facing the dispersal of her children to the four corners of the planet, Las Vegas matriarch Fanny Thornton Reed places the management of Babylon, the fabulous family casino, in the hands of unscrupulous schemer Jeff, her late husband&#39;s illegitimate son. 100,000 first printing.</p><p>FERN MICHAELS is the USA Today and New York Times bestselling author of the Sisterhood series, Mr. and Miss Anonymous, Up Close and Personal, and dozens of other novels and novellas. There are over seventy million copies of her books in print. Fern Michaels has built and funded several large day-care centers in her hometown, and is apassionate animal lover who has outfitted police dogs across the country with special bulletproof vests. She shares her home in South Carolina with her four dogs and a resident ghost named Mary Margaret.The final installment of Michaels's Vegas trilogy is even more over the top than its predecessors (Vegas Rich, 1996; Vegas Heat, p. 87). Here, matriarch Fanny Coleman Thornton confronts all her old demons and some new ones too as she oversees Babylon, the family casino, with her by now characteristic blend of steel nerves and fluttering indecision. Her four children aren't always a help. Son Birch finally returns from South America with new wife Celia in tow--a conniving gold-digger as everyone (but Birch) knows. Birch's saintly twin Sage is having problems with his equally saintly (and pregnant) wife Iris. Sunny, who has inexplicably been institutionalized with multiple sclerosis despite complete wheelchair mobility and no negative effects to her mental capacity (she's still portrayed as the sharpest Thornton child), wants to marry her also-wheelchair-bound beau. And, finally, Billie, the child no one ever had to worry about, has been sneaking around Vegas incognito in a desperate attempt to conceal her gambling addiction from the family. When Fanny allows her former (and deceased) husband Ash's illegitimate son Jeff Lassiter to take over the day-to-day operations of Babylon, everyone's life is thrown into an utter uproar--especially after Sage discovers (thanks to longtime friends in service as spies) that Jeff and Celia are in cahoots. Meanwhile, the least appealing aspect of this third, and purported last, installment in the saga is that the dead Ash is given one of the leading roles; he appears to all the Thorntons as a vision in times of crisis, doling out advice in his customary crotchety manner. Before his demise Ash was tolerable, but as a ghost he's insufferable. Far too many Thorntons and entrepreneurial schemes (casinos in Atlantic City, free-range chicken farms, fast-food restaurants, etc.) clutter this already jam-packed finale. -- <i>Copyright �1997, Kirkus Associates, LP.

From an early age, from the time Bimaadiz was fi ve or six, upon watching the men prepare to hunt, he would set up a piteous wail until Jiigibiig - not without some embarrassment - fi tted him with his own set of snowshoes made just for him and told him to follow along. Once in the bush he quieted down and never once scared the game by making noise and never once ruined the hunt by urinating when the wind might blow the scent toward the game. He was happy only when he was in the woods - and so, since Jiigibiig and Zhookaagiizhigookwe only wanted Bimaadiz to be happy, they let him go hunting at his pleasure. By the time he turned sixteen (and the time at which our story really begins), he was such an accomplished hunter he single - handedly supplied the village with most of the meat it needed. Such was his skill and care that Jiigibiig let the youngster use the Winchester repeating rifl e. Bimaadiz didn't need more than one shot, unless there was more than one deer or moose, but it was an honor to carry it. Jiigibiig and Zhookaagiizhigookwe, and those who remembered how he was found, suspected his power was the result of his contact with the cow moose during his infancy. Once, after hearing Bimaadiz shoot, Jiigibiig walked back into the woods with a sled to help him haul out his catch (for he was sure to have killed something, no doubt there was meat cooling on the ground), and he saw Bimaadiz kneeling over a dead moose, singing gently to the animal as he skinned it. It sounded like a lullaby, not a victory song, and the way Bimaadiz skinned the animal made the scene seem more like a birth than butchery. Because of the nimbus of affection surrounding him and because of the gifts given to him by his fi rst mother and the milk he received from his second mother, the moose, Bimaadiz grew into a singular young man. He was tall and strong but not thick; his body was supple and slender, with wide shoulders and very long fi ngers. His waist was narrow, but like a coiled spring - full of potential strength. His black hair was thick and smooth and he kept it cut short and parted in the middle, slicked down with hair oil. All the girls, even the older women, gasped when he walked by. It was a good life at Agencytown in those years; meat was never so plentiful and everyone loved the quiet hunter who provided for them so well.<br><br>2. Eta had grown up, too. She alone, perhaps, possessed more beauty than Bimaadiz did. She was tall for her age, and though not fi ne boned, she was lean and strong. Yet she had delicate fi ngers, and straight black hair that was always in two braids that hung down to her lower back. Her waist was narrow and her breasts, in advance of her years, were round and fi rm. All the boys and all the men sighed when she walked past. Her skin was smooth, clear, coppery, and healthy year round, except on her left cheek there was a dark round mark, very faint, that looked as though it had been left there when the wolf who had suckled her had kissed her cheek with her nose. It was really only a birthmark, it had been there before the she - wolf nosed the infant, but Aantti and Mary liked to think the wolf had left its mark. It seemed to the villagers that Eta had acquired some of the wolf's characteristics: she was incredibly intelligent, patient, concerned for others, and serious when anyone was looking, but silly and girl - like when she thought she was unobserved. Aantti and Mary were overjoyed at the unexpected gift of a daughter, especially since they thought they would never have one of their own. And so, being the object of so much happiness, Eta grew up receiving happiness. Her parents doted on her and gave her whatever it was that she wanted. They didn't have much to give - a poor sawyer and his Indian wife. Buttons, a bit of cloth, these were her toys. But all the same, the girl didn't want much. And she worked hard. Once her mother saw her hanging off the pump handle, her feet off the ground, as she tried to fi ll the water bucket. She helped her mother in all things - fetching water, wrapping big blue stem with wiigoob to make brooms and whisks. The thing she really wanted was to accompany her mother on the trapline, and this from even before she could walk properly. Mary bundled her in furs and placed her in the toboggan along with the snares and mink bait and set off for the string of lean - tos and temporary shelters along their trapping grounds. Mary never had to worry that Eta would struggle out of her wrappings or cry with impatience or trample the clean trails where she set the snares for rabbit and fox. Eta stayed in the toboggan, and as long as she could see above the tumble of tools and furs and watch Mary's hands at work, she was happy. Even when she was teething, all her mother had to do, upon fi nding a rabbit in a snare, was cut off the lower leg and hand it to Eta for her to chew on - the fl esh was so tough and cold, so laced with tendons that the rubbery texture soothed Eta's gums and she did not cry and sat quietly and observed Mary's broad back in front of the heavily loaded toboggan. As soon as she could walk, Eta followed behind the toboggan. Sometimes Mary pulled out of sight because Eta was still a small child and could not keep up, but all she had to do was follow the marks left by the toboggan and she would catch up eventually. By the time she was six years old she was setting all the rabbit snares herself. They never ate so many rabbits as when Eta set her snares. She secured them at just the right height and was so adept at matching the color of the snare to its surroundings that even a creature as suspicious as a rabbit could not see it. Mary said nothing about why she thought Eta was such a good trapper, but she suspected it was a result of her contact with the she - wolf, a benefi t of the wolf's milk. By the time Eta was twelve years old (and the point at which our story starts), she had taken over all the trapping. Mary could stay in the village and found much relief in her daughter's abilities; Mary was getting old and trapping had become diffi cult. For Eta trapping was as easy as breathing. She loaded the sled herself and, sometimes with a team of dogs pulling the sled, sometimes pulling it herself, set off for weeks at a time. When she came back the sled would always be full of fur - beaver, mink, martin, fi sher, weasel, bobcat, lynx - and loaded with meat too because sometimes she did some hunting on the side. Aantti was so pleased he gave her his puukko, the only possession that remained with him that he had taken from Finland. It had been his father's and the curved steel blade was perfect for skinning. Eta kept it sharp and made sure it never rusted. Who could hope for a better child? Skilled, earnest, respectful, concerned only for her parents and the animals she trapped. Her parents' only worry was about her beauty. She was so beautiful she caused everyone near her to shudder with longing, to stand up straight, to talk loudly in voices meant for her to hear. Some of them bragged about what they'd caught in their traps. But this only made her ignore them all the more. Eta loved the animals she trapped and took care to put their carcasses where the dogs would not ravage them. She brushed their fur before she sold them, conscious always of the life the animals were bestowing on her family. To brag about killing them was beneath her contempt. So, for the time being, Aantti and Mary put their worries aside. Eta seemed to be safe from the dangers of desire.<br><br>3. Bimaadiz had one other interest other than hunting and that was Eta. As for the beautiful girl, Bimaadiz was as precious to her as the animals she trapped. From an early age Bimaadiz's hunting and Eta's trapping had brought them together since his hunting grounds and her trapline overlapped. Bimaadiz, drawing out the fi rst syllable of her name, would say &#x201c;Eh - taa&#x201d; - and shyly, in response, she would elongate the second syllable of his name, saying Bi - maaa - diz&#x201d; - and so they had a special of addressing each other and took the greatest pleasure in each other's company. Bimaadiz would tell Eta where he had seen some rich fox runs and so, on his advice, Eta would hang her snares there to catch them. For her part, upon seeing moose tracks around an isolated slough, she would inform Bimaadiz and, sure enough, a few days later he would have killed a fat cow and a tender calf, enough to feed to the whole village for a week. They were such good friends that he would save the tongue for her and her parents. And having caught a fawn in one her snares, she tanned the hide and sewed it into a bandolier bag for Bimaadiz to keep his shells and food in. When she was sick, he would check her traps for her, and she would kill some game for him when he had other chores to do around Agencytown and could not get out into the woods. But they were children after all, and so their activities weren't always so serious. As a joke she made a doll out of marsh grass (having no cornhusks at that season to make a proper doll). She used the guard hairs from a fi sher for the doll's braids, and the broken trigger from a steel trap was used to represent his gun. All in all it was a good likeness of Bimaadiz. Seeing some deer tracks she set the doll on the trail where she knew Bimaadiz would fi nd it. Bimaadiz also made trinkets for his friend - toy snares only big enough for mice and hoops made from willow twigs for stretching them. This continued - their ideal friendship, their ideal life, until the spirits conspired to make things more diffi cult for the two. Dr Apelles looks back down at the manuscript. The bell will sound at any moment now. His translation has lodged itself deep in his consciousness. It, and another signifi cant question, continue to plague him. But now, it is no accident, his thoughts turn to the library - not this one, not the archive - in which he works. It is universally acknowledged that - in addition to the history of Charlemagne and of the printing press and also in addition to narratives told to us by a friend detailing the dreams of other friends of his whom we do not know - the description of a person's typical day at work is among the most boring kind of story in existence. However, since Dr Apelles' vacation in the country of his imagination, governed in part by the itinerary of the manuscript, which, it must be said, is also impossibly linked to his daily work, we must follow him to work and hear out the story of his days. The bell will ring soon. It should be said that the archive to which he goes every other Friday is, strictly speaking, not a library, and neither is the building in which he works the other nine days out of the fortnight. Those days, the nine days (not counting holidays and weekends) out of fourteen that form the architecture of his life if not the action (though this will change), are spent at RECAP, which, as we have said, is a library but also is not a library. Since, if it isn't apparent yet, RECAP is a place where books are captured, tagged, and then withheld from - not released into - the general population of other books; where, to put it another way, books are forced into a system designed to keep track of how they are forgotten; that is, designed to give structure and meaning to ignorance and anonymity; to create a special place for books that haven't been read or if they have, not often enough; all of this is to say that, contrary to what we have come to expect from stories such as this - the forgotten or unknown or undervalued or obsolete signifi cance of Dr Apelles' works and days - the dusty corners of his life, if his life were a house (and if it were we would expect to fi nd it represented by, signifi ed by, a single dusty houseplant, an umbrella, or a shoe tree at best, and an empty fl ower pot, a persistent water ring on the fl oor, and a broken bit of string, at worst), is where we should begin looking at the no longer dreary dream of Dr Apelles' days. He had long been settled in apartment 33 J. Long enough to have begun to feel as though he owned the place. He was well thought of in the neighborhood of the other apartments. Having lived there for so long, he possessed a remarkable amount of information about his neighbors: their ages and ailments, the progressive ages of their children, their various and varied occupations and so on. Most of all, he was quite good at remembering names. And so, when in conversation with his neighbors they always felt, given Dr Apelles' polite and thoroughly informed interest, that his portraits of them, of their public and semi - public virtues, were such accurate and pleasing likenesses that he was, as far as they were concerned, the perfect neighbor. In short, he flattered them, but not intentionally.</p><h2>Lettera, Vol. 3: A Standard Book of Fine Lettering</h2><p>Volume 3 of the series, originally published in 1968, contains 80 alphabets.

"I'm fine."</p><p>"And pigs can fly." Craig advanced into Gideon's office.</p><p>"If they pay cash I'll fly them anywhere they want to go." Gideon sat up. His less-than-witty comeback was followed by a ragged, painful cough. A bone-deep shiver shook his body.</p><p>Craig took a step back. "You're spreading germs, man."</p><p>"So leave." Was a half hour of peace and quiet too much to ask? The drone of the television in the waiting area supplied just the right amount of white noise to let him drift off.</p><p>"You're the one leaving&#x2014;for <i>home."</i></p><p>"I can't go anywhere until this next load of freight gets here. Then I'm taking it to Caribou." Gideon barely recognized his raspy voice. He sounded almost as bad as he felt. Almost.</p><p>"If I was sick as a dog, you wouldn't let me fly a kite, let alone your prize Cessna."</p><p>It wasn't like Gideon had a choice. Their business was finally showing a profit. A small one, but it was something to build on. He'd make today's flight. If his austere Amish upbringing had taught him anything, it was the value of hard work. "I've got a contract to fulfill."</p><p>Shaking his head, Craig said, <i>"We've</i> got a contract. I know you think you're indispensable, Booker, but you're not."</p><p>The two men had known each other for six years, since their flight school days. It had been Craig who'd given Gideon his nickname on the first day of class. Gideon&#x2014;Bible&#x2014;the Book. Hence, Booker. Gideon had returned the favor a few weeks later when their trainer plane experienced mechanical trouble the first two times Craig took the controls. Craig was saddled with "Law" as in Murphy's Law. If anything can go wrong, it will.</p><p>"Are you offering to take this run?" Gideon took a swig of lukewarm coffee from the black mug on the corner of his desk. It turned into razor blades sliding down his throat.</p><p>"Yes. Go home and get some rest."</p><p>Gideon looked at him in surprise. "You mean that? I thought you had plans with Melody?"</p><p>"We're sort of on the outs. Caribou in October will be warmer than the reception waiting for me the next time I see her."</p><p>A woman's voice from the other room said, "That's because you're a knucklehead."</p><p>Craig rolled his eyes and raised his voice. "Stop giving people a piece of your mind, Roseanne. It's almost gone."</p><p>Gideon rose to his feet. The room spun wildly for a second before settling back into his cluttered office.</p><p>Craig put out a hand to steady him. "You're grounded, buddy. Not another word."</p><p>Gideon hated to admit it, but he was in no shape to be in a cockpit. "Thanks, Law. I owe you one."</p><p>Craig leaned closer. "Roseanne is making me do it."</p><p>Gideon cracked a grin. Their secretary's powers of persuasion were legendary. She might look like someone's cookie-baking grandmother with her gray hair pulled back in a bun, but she didn't have a maternal bone in her body.</p><p>"I'll be back tomorrow," Gideon promised.</p><p>Roseanne came around Craig with Gideon's coat in her hands. "You will not come back for a week."</p><p>Gideon scowled at her. "Tell me again who's the boss here?"</p><p>Roseanne plopped her hands on her ample hips. "You two might own this business, but I run it. If I come down sick, we're really in trouble. Who can handle the computer, the phone, the fax machine, invoices, accounts payable and the coffeepot all without leaving her chair?"</p><p>"You," he and Craig said together.</p><p>Gideon smiled. "You're indispensable, Roseanne."</p><p>"And you're sick. Get out of here and take this with you." She held out a foam cup with a lid on it.</p><p>"What's this?"</p><p>"Your favorite brand of blackcurrant tea. I'd send some chicken soup home with you, but I don't have any here."</p><p>Blackcurrant tea had been his mother's surefire remedy for sore throats when he was growing up. He'd thought about sending her a box of this gourmet blend, but he knew she wouldn't accept it. Not from the black sheep of the family. Gideon was the only one of her five children who'd left the Amish faith.</p><p>As if his thoughts of home brought up a connection, he heard the words <i>Amish country</i> on the television. Glancing toward the small screen, he saw a female reporter, bundled against the brisk October chill, gesturing to a row of Amish buggies lined up behind her.</p><p>"Roseanne, turn that up, please." His voice was failing him. The words barely squeaked out.</p><p>She sighed, but picked up the remote and raised the sound level so he could hear the reporter.</p><p>"Preparations are under way in Hope Springs, Ohio, for this quiet Amish community's largest event of the year. The Quilts of Hope charity auction is being held here this weekend."</p><p>Craig moved to stand beside Gideon. "Is that where you're from?"</p><p>"Nearby." Hope Springs was forty miles from his father's farm, but Gideon had never been there. Until he left the Amish he hadn't traveled more than twenty miles from the farm where he was born. Now he lived in Rochester, New York, and he'd been to every state and all but one Canadian province.</p><p>The camera panned away from the buggies to a group of Amish men raising an enormous red-and-white-striped tent. After a second, the camera swung back to the reporter and followed her until she stopped in front of an intricately pieced quilt hanging on a display frame. "In the past, this event has raised thousands of dollars for the special needs of Amish families throughout Ohio. This year they are helping one of their own."</p><p>Roseanne said, "Now, that's pretty. I wouldn't mind owning a quilt like that."</p><p>The reporter ran her hand down the cloth and the camera zoomed in to capture the details. "Rebecca Beachy is the Amish woman who made this incredible quilt."</p><p>"It can't be." In an instant, Gideon was transported back to his youth when he had courted the prettiest girl in Berlin, Ohio. The girl who broke his heart and turned him down flat when he'd finally found the courage to propose.</p><p>"Someone you know?" Craig asked.</p><p>"No. There are a lot of Beachys in Ohio. The girl I knew would be married to some Amish farmer or carpenter." It was the life Rebecca wanted&#x2014;as long as he wasn't the farmer or the carpenter. Chances were slim that it was the same woman, but his gaze stayed glued to the screen.</p><p>The camera switched to a group of Amish women who were talking. The women didn't realize they were being filmed. They were dressed alike in dark coats and bonnets. One held a baby on her hip, but it was the woman in the center that he strained to see.</p><p>The reporter's voice cut into Gideon's thoughts. "The money from this year's auction is going to help pay for some very specialized surgery for Miss Beachy."</p><p>The camera zoomed in on the group of women and Rebecca's face filled the television screen. The sight knocked the breath from his body. After almost ten years, his heart still ached at the sight of her. She was more beautiful than ever. Her heart-shaped face with those stunning high cheekbones had matured from the soft roundness of youth into a quiet elegance.</p><p>"Why do they wear those odd white hats?" Roseanne asked.</p><p>"It's called a prayer <i>kapp.</i> Amish women believe the Bible commands them to cover their hair when they pray."</p><p>"But they don't just wear them in church?" Roseanne turned to stare at him, waiting for an explanation.</p><p>He wanted to hear what the reporter was saying. "A woman might want to pray anytime, so she keeps her head covered all day. They never cut their hair, either."</p><p>Rebecca's blond hair must be past her hips by now. He'd seen it down only once. It was the night he talked Rebecca into going to a hoedown with him and his rowdy friends.</p><p><i>Hoedown</i> was a benign name for a weekend-long party with loud music, alcohol and drugs attended by some of the wilder Amish youth during their rumspringa, or running-around time. He had made the most of his rumspringa and partied hard. For Rebecca, that one party had been her only venture on the wild side.</p><p>Gideon took the remote from his secretary and turned up the volume. The TV reporter droned on. "Miss Beachy stitched this beautiful quilt entirely by hand. What's even more amazing is that she is totally blind."</p><p>"How on earth can a blind woman make a quilt?" Rose-anne's skeptical comment barely registered in Gideon's brain.</p><p><i>Rebecca was blind?</i></p><p>Suddenly, he was gasping for air and coughing so hard his head pounded. It took a minute to catch his breath. Roseanne pulled the lid off the tea and offered him some. He took a grateful sip.</p><p>Concern filled her eyes. "Do you know her?"</p><p>"I once asked her to marry me. I think if she had said yes, I would be a bearded Amish farmer now." With a blind wife.</p><p>Rebecca was blind. He couldn't wrap his brain around the fact. Why? When had it happened? The thought of the vibrant woman he'd known living her life in darkness left an ache in his chest that had nothing to do with the flu. Before he could gather more details, the news program moved on to the weather forecast and warnings about an artic front plowing southward delivering early ice and snow in its wake.</p><p>Craig said, "I read the Amish don't believe in health insurance. Is that true?"</p><p>"Most don't. The community would rally round a family that had big medical expenses, but they could only do so much."</p><p>Gideon had to help. He pulled his pho...</p></p><h2>Batman: Cataclysm</h2><p>100% Satisfaction is Guaranteed! For New condition books in our store; You will be the first user.

As well, Arlen muses on the English upper classes, still dazed by the First World War, and regales the reader with philosophical asides and re?ections on the nature of women, drunkenness, doctors who specialize in diseases of the rich, the management of nightclubs, and much more: ?nally delivering a shattering ending to this quest for the true nature of his heroine</p><p>Michael Arlen (1895&#x2013;1956) wrote many novels, including <i>Men Dislike Women</i> and&nbsp;<i>Young Men in Love</i> but&nbsp;achieved his greatest&nbsp;fame with the publication of <i>The Green Hat</i> in 1924.&nbsp;Kirsty Gunn's&nbsp;novels include&nbsp;<i>Featherstone</i>, <i>The Keepsake</i>, <i>Rain</i>, and <i>This Place You Return to Is Home.</i>"No one was better than he at writing about 'silly young Lords, who drink champagne in the morning, and marvelous new 1920s women, who swear (ever so slightly) and are bored with silly young Lords.'"&nbsp; <i>&#x2014;Time Magazine</i></p><h2>The Choice: Global Domination or Global Leadership</h2><p>The overwhelming reality of our time is this: In the opening years of the 21st century, the United States finds itself not only the most powerful nation on earth but the most powerful nation that has ever existed. Given the contradictory roles America plays in the world, we are fated to be the catalyst for either a new global community or for global chaos. If we don&#39;t lead, Zbigniew Brzezinski contends, rather than merely dominate by force, we could face worldwide hostility much like the regional hostility now confronting Israel.Brzezinski argues for a more complex and sophisticated view of our global role than much of our media and political leadership are willing to entertain. We are the world&#39;s policeman, but we have to be seen as a fair one. We are entitled to a higher level of security than other nations (because we assume greater risks), but we are also the proponent of essential freedoms. We are uniquely powerful, but our homeland is uniquely -and chronically-vulnerable. &#34;Globalization&#34; precludes immunity for even the most powerful. This is an impressively lucid assessment, informed by decades of experience on the front lines of foreign policy, of where we stand in the world and where we should go from here.</p><p><b>Zbigniew Brzezinski</b>, the National Security Advisor to President Jimmy Carter, is a counselor and trustee at the Center for Strategic and International Studies and a professor of American foreign policy at the School of Advanced International Studies, the Johns Hopkins University, both located in Washington, D.C. His many books include <i>The Choice</i> and <i>The Grand Chessboard</i> . He lives in Washington, D.C.Brzezinski, President Carter's national security adviser and the author of The Grand Chessboard, has written a perceptive overview of the disorienting new strategic challenges America faces. Though couched in the sober, nuanced language of policymaking, the book amounts to a point-by-point rebuttal of the Bush doctrine. Brzezinski criticizes what he casts as the administration's rejection of a binding alliance system in favor of ad hoc coalitions, its advocacy of preemptive war, and its refusal to address terrorism's root causes. The underlying problem, says Brzezinski, is turmoil in the "Greater Balkans," the largely Muslim southern rim of central Eurasia. While not ruling out unilateral action by America, Brzezinski believes the ultimate solution to the region's problems involves the slow expansion of the trans-Atlantic zone of prosperity and cooperative institutions. Al-Qaeda's brand of Islamic fundamentalism is in decline, he says, but "Islamist populism," its more pragmatic relation, could cause localized instability. To promote a modernizing impulse in the Muslim world, Brzezinski recommends engagement with Iran, peacemaking in the Middle East and Kashmir, and a regional nuclear nonproliferation pact. In his survey of other security threats, Brzezinski says that as China's economy grows and Japan drifts toward remilitarization, America should help build an equivalent to NATO for the Pacific. Brzezinski warns that globalization's reputation as disruptive, undemocratic and unfair could provoke a virulent anti-American ideology. To avoid becoming a "garrison state," America must establish a "co-optive hegemony," leading a "global community of shared interests." This book makes an exemplary argument for the proposition that idealistic internationalism is "the common-sense dictate of hard-nosed realism." <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

They have greatly increased the life-expectancy of those of us who live in &#34;advanced&#34; countries, but they have destabilized society, have made life unfulfilling, have subjected human beings to indignities, have led to widespread psychological suffering (in the Third World to physical suffering as well) and have inflicted severe damage on the natural world.

New Introductory Lectures On Psychoanalysis</h2><p><p><strong>Of the various English translations of Freud's major works to appear in his lifetime, only one was authorized by Freud himself: <em>The Standard Edition of the Complete Psychological Works of Sigmund Freud</em> under the general editorship of James Strachey.</strong></p> Freud approved the overall editorial plan, specific renderings of key words and phrases, and the addition of valuable notes, from bibliographical and explanatory. Many of the translations were done by Strachey himself; the rest were prepared under his supervision. The result was to place the <em>Standard Edition</em> in a position of unquestioned supremacy over all other existing versions.

From Plato to C. P. Snow to Nicolas Sarkozy, literature&#x2019;s haters have questioned the value of literature&#x2015;its truthfulness, virtue, and usefulness&#x2015;and have attempted to demonstrate its harmfulness.</p><p>Literature does not start with Homer or <i>Gilgamesh</i>, William Marx says, but with Plato driving the poets out of the city, like God casting Adam and Eve out of Paradise. That is its genesis. From Plato the poets learned for the first time that they served not truth but merely the Muses. It is no mere coincidence that the love of wisdom (<i>philosophia</i>) coincided with the hatred of poetry. Literature was born of scandal, and scandal has defined it ever since.</p><p>In the long rhetorical war against literature, Marx identifies four indictments&#x2015;in the name of authority, truth, morality, and society. This typology allows him to move in an associative way through the centuries. In describing the misplaced ambitions, corruptible powers, and abysmal failures of literature, anti-literary discourses make explicit what a given society came to expect from literature. In this way, anti-literature paradoxically asserts the validity of what it wishes to deny. The only threat to literature&#x2019;s continued existence, Marx writes, is not hatred but indifference.</p></p><p>William Marx is Professor of Comparative Literature at the University of Paris Nanterre.&#x201c;Literature has faced myriad accusations from the powers that be, who have...criticized its immortality, contested its truth value in comparison with science, and attacked the figure of the writer... Paradoxically, it is anti-literary discourse that has created the identity of literature. [William Marx] turns poets and novelists into eternal resistance fighters defending from the margins an art without faith or law, a practice that has no stable definition or real place in society... It is thus a secret war that Marx describes, with humor and erudition worthy of Umberto Eco.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b><i>Marianne</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;If the defenders of literature often admit that they do not know how to define literature, its critics are very happy to take up the charge. Beginning with Plato...William Marx examines four aspects of the vast indictment that has been brought against poetry... <i>The Hatred of Literature</i> is not a judicial appeal, but a reflection on how difficult it is to define an art that, over the centuries, has rejected everything it could have laid claim to and as a result has been forced to fall back on itself.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b><i>Le Monde</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;An in-depth history of literature as it is understood by its most virulent detractors&#x2015;the age-old purveyors of &#x2018;anti-literature.&#x2019; From Plato&#x2019;s condemnation of poetry to contemporary attempts to ban &#x2018;triggering&#x2019; books, literature has long been subjected to intellectual assault by philistines and philosophers alike...In an age in which the study of literature, and the arts in general, seems particularly vulnerable, Marx&#x2019;s book is exceedingly relevant.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Andrew Shea</b><b>, </b><b><i>New Criterion</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;Those who have spent their lives hating literature have done so because it&#x2019;s always been a threat to the status quo or ruling parties...In his comprehensive and rich examination of how and why literature has always been on trial, Marx&#x2019;s <i>The Hatred of Literature</i> carefully spells out how the four indictments (Authority, Truth, Morality, and Society) against the form have served to threaten our existence as thinking people and weaken the fabric of society...Marx looks at literature through the eyes of its foes. He weaves in political leaders, philosophers, theologians, and professorial types whose missions often seem to be at odds with the more high-minded pursuits of the form.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Christopher John Stephens</b><b>, </b><b><i>PopMatters</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;[Marx&#x2019;s] book is a sparkling constellation of wit, learning and insight.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Gary Day</b><b>, </b><b><i>Times Higher Education</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;Defining literature by its enemies is a neat strategy&#x2015;and thanks to Marx&#x2019;s light touch, the book is fun to read. I suspect that Marx secretly likes the attacks he describes with so much relish because they dovetail with his own view of literature as standing in opposition to powerful discourses such as philosophy, science, morality, religion, and social utility.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Martin Puchner</b><b>, </b><b><i>Public Books</i></b></p><h2>Her Majesty&#39;s Dog Vol. 8</h2><p>At least one Kamori family enemy has been revealed, but Amane&#39;s and Hyoue&#39;s troubles are far from over.

Tour.</p><p>For three decades, primatologist Roger Fouts has been involved in language studies of the chimpanzee, the animal most closely related to human beings. Among his subjects was the renowned Washoe, who was &#34;endowed with a powerful need to learn and communicate,&#34; and who developed an extraordinary vocabulary in American Sign Language. Another chimpanzee, Fouts writes, &#34;never made a grammatical error,&#34; which turned a whole school of linguistic theory upside down. While reporting these successes, Fouts also notes that chimpanzees are regularly abused in laboratory settings and that in the wild their number has fallen from 5,000,000 to fewer than 175,000 in the last century.Marion Morra is the Associate Director of the Yale Cancer Center in New Haven, Connecticut.

Maybe it was because I had a pretty rough childhood, or perhaps it was because I was always more than a little insecure, but as a kid I longed to see myself ten feet tall on the big screen. Through no fault of my teachers, I received almost no formal education, but after I spent three years in the Navy during World War II, the GI Bill allowed me to go to acting school on the government&#x2019;s nickel. I may not have had much schooling, but it turned out I had a gift for acting. When I walked out on that stage, it felt like a hand in a velvet glove. I wasn&#x2019;t scared; I wasn&#x2019;t even nervous. I just loved being the center of attention, just like I&#x2019;d always known I would.<br><br>I performed in summer stock, and I acted in Clifford Odets&#x2019;s play <i>Golden Boy</i> exactly twice over a single weekend, but before I knew it I had been summoned to meet a studio executive at Universal Studios. It was the spring of 1948. I was excited, but<br>I wasn&#x2019;t surprised. Going to Hollywood had been my life&#x2019;s plan since I could remember, and I was too naive to know it almost never works out that way.<br><br>I got myself out to New York&#x2019;s Idlewild Airport (now JFK) and boarded a TWA Super Constellation, a four-engine prop plane bound for Los Angeles. I had never been on a Super Constellation before, but I knew all about it from movies and magazines.<br>I was served a little lunch. The stewardesses were real nice to me. One of them was very pretty, so I had a chance to flirt. I was just a kid, but already I loved flirting. Mostly I succeeded in sparking some kind of response, which was what I lived for.<br><br>On my first flight to LA, I sat in coach. In those days the sections weren&#x2019;t partitioned, so I could see into first class, where a man with a mustache and a herringbone suit was being tended to by what was clearly a personal assistant. The guy in the suit would whisper something to the other man, who would jump up and do his bidding.<br><br>To my surprise, a little while after we took off the assistant came over and asked me, &#x201c;Could you join my friend in first class?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Sure,&#x201d; I said. I got up and walked forward to Herringbone Suit. I had no idea who he was, but he was cordial and expressed interest in why I was going to LA.<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m going to be an actor.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I figured you might be,&#x201d; he said.<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve got a meeting at Universal,&#x201d; I said.<br><br>&#x201c;Do you know anything about the other studios?&#x201d; he asked.<br><br>I had heard the same Hollywood gossip as everyone else, but I had paid special attention to it, knowing that this was where I would work one day. So I said, &#x201c;Warner Brothers is a tough studio to work for. Twentieth Century Fox makes action pictures. At MGM you have to sing and dance a little bit. RKO wants actors who are stable. And Universal wants young people. So that&#x2019;s where I&#x2019;m going.&#x201d;<br><br>We talked for a few moments, and then I went back to my seat and fell asleep. After we landed, I went to pick up my luggage and there was Herringbone Suit, waiting for his assistant to fetch his bags. He saw me and said, &#x201c;Can I offer you a ride?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;That would be great, thanks. I&#x2019;m staying at the Hollywood Knickerbocker Hotel.&#x201d;<br><br>He said, &#x201c;My driver will take me home first, then he&#x2019;ll be happy to drop you off at your hotel.&#x201d;<br><br>We drove through the winding streets of Beverly Hills for a while before finally pulling up to a big metal gate. Barely visible through the trees and groomed shrubbery was a tasteful mansion.<br><br>After we pulled up to it and my benefactor&#x2019;s bags were unloaded, he reached over and shook my hand.<br><br>I said, &#x201c;Well, it was a pleasure meeting you. And thanks for the ride. My name is Bernie Schwartz. What&#x2019;s yours?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Jack Warner,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Let me tell you something, kid. If Universal ever drops you, come see me. I&#x2019;ll change your name to Tyrone Goldfarb and make you a star all over the world!&#x201d;<br><br>We both laughed. Warner got out, and his limo driver took me to the Hollywood Knickerbocker Hotel, where I slept like a baby.<br><br>The next morning I walked from the hotel to a big intersection at Highland Avenue, where a trolley took me into the San Fernando Valley, up the middle of the street, ending up at Universal Studios. After I got off, I walked under a bridge with the freeway overhead until I came to the Universal lot.<br><br>I walked right up to the gate. Now it was starting to hit me.<br><br>This was an absolutely thrilling experience for a twenty-twoyear-old kid fresh from the streets of New York. My whole life I had dreamed of being an actor in a movie studio, and here I was about to walk through the entrance of Universal Pictures as a prospective employee. I pinched myself, but the dream continued.<br><br>The gatekeeper told me to go to a door marked casting. I walked through it and up to a big, gleaming desk. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve been invited to come to the studio for a meeting,&#x201d; I said.<br><br>A girl behind the desk looked up at me and said, &#x201c;What&#x2019;s your name?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Bernie Schwartz.&#x201d; Now I had my heart in my throat. I thought, <i>Suppose this is a big fucking joke?</i> I was pretty sure it had to be more than that because the studio had sent me a plane ticket. But what was a hundred and twelve dollars to a movie studio? So I held my breath for the long moment before she said, &#x201c;Yes. Here you are on the list. Welcome to Universal Studios, Mr. Schwartz. You have an appointment this morning with Mr. Goldstein. To get to his office, turn right when you come out of the gate across from the barbershop, go up the path, and you&#x2019;ll see his name on the door.&#x201d;<br><br>I was amazed. Not only had she known my name, but she was sending me directly to the office of the man who ran things at Universal. As soon as I left her, though, I got completely lost, so I figured maybe this was an opportunity to make a spur-ofthe-<br>moment detour. In New York I had gone to see some filming of <i>The Naked City,</i> a Universal picture. Howard Duff was the star. While I stood there watching the location shoot, I struck up a conversation with the propman. We talked, and I told him I<br>wanted to be in the movies.<br><br>He laughed, but not unkindly. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t break your heart,&#x201d; he said to me. &#x201c;Just enjoy going to the pictures and don&#x2019;t even think about working in the business. It&#x2019;s just too tough. You have no chance at all.&#x201d;<br><br>So while I was wandering around lost on my way to see Mr. Goldstein, I decided to see if I could find my friend the propman.<br><br>It turned out the props department was right nearby, and there he was.<br><br>He remembered me. &#x201c;Hey, kid. How are you? How did you get in the lot?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m here to sign a contract,&#x201d; I said.<br><br>&#x201c;No!&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yep.&#x201d;<br><br>He was genuinely happy to see me and took obvious pleasure in my good fortune. He gave me directions to Bob Goldstein&#x2019;s office, and not long after that I arrived at the studio&#x2019;s inner sanctum, where all the executives had bungalows interspersed with perfectly groomed lawns. I walked along the path to an office<br>marked goldstein, where a well-dressed woman looked me over<br>coolly.<br><br>&#x201c;Mr. Schwartz?&#x201d; No one had <i>ever</i> called me Mr. Schwartz before.<br><br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s me,&#x201d; I said.<br><br>&#x201c;Just a moment, please.&#x201d;<br><br>The door opened. Bob Goldstein was in town for a couple of days and was using his brother Leonard&#x2019;s office. Bob sat me down, and we talked. He showed me my contract and said it would be good for seven years, with options renewable every six months, at<br>the studio&#x2019;s discretion. Each time they renewed I&#x2019;d get a raise. My starting salary would be seventy-five dollars a week.<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll take it,&#x201d; I said. He laughed. I picked up the pen to sign the last page, and he said, &#x201c;Never sign anything until you read it.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;There are a lot of pages,&#x201d; I said.<br><br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t give a shit,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Sit down and read it. I&#x2019;ll be back in an hour.&#x201d;<br><br>I didn&#x2019;t have the patience to read every page, but I flipped to the section that related to payment: if they were renewed, my six-month options would go from a starting salary of seventy-five dollars a week up to twelve hundred a week at the end of seven years. Other than that all I could make out was page after page of whereofs and wherefores. When Goldstein came back to his office I was reading magazines, having spent all of four minutes scanning the contract. I&#x2019;m sure he knew that. I signed&nbsp;on June 2, 1948, one day before my twenty-third birthday. I was officially under contract. Bernie Schwartz was in the movies.<br><br>Now that I knew I was going to live in LA, at least for six months, the first thing I had to do was find a place to live. The studio had been picking up my tab at the Knickerbocker Hotel, but I didn&#x2019;t want to overstay my welcome. I had heard about a rooming house on Sycamore Street where five or six other Universal actors lived. I could get breakfast and a room there for thirty dollars a month, which I could swing on my seventy-five dollars a week and still have some money left over for a car.<br><br>I moved in with whatever I had in my suitcase: a toothbrush, a comb, and some clothes.

Owen Barfield&#39;s original and thought-provoking works over three-quarters of a century made him a legendary cult figure. This popular book provides a brief, brilliant history of those who have spoken the Indo-European tongues. It is illustrated throughout by current English words - whose derivation from other languages, whose history in use and changes of meaning - record and unlock the larger history.</p><p>Owen Barfield (1898-1997), British philosopher and critic, has been called the &#34;First and Last Inkling&#34; because of his influential and enduring role in the group known as the Oxford Inklings, which included C.S. lewis, J.R.R. Tolkien, and Charles Williams. It was Barfield who first advanced the ideas about language, myth, and belief that became identified with the thought and art of the Inklings. The author of numerous books, his history of the evolution of human consciousness, Saving the Appearances: A Study in Idolatry, achieved a place in the list of the &#39;100 Best Spiritual Books of the Century&#39;.A joy to read but also of great moral value in the unending battle between civilization and barbarism. -- <i>W.

Liebling's images are startlingly unadorned, sometimes ironically witty depictions of people, animals, and environments, all of which refuse to surrender to time or circumstance without a fight. Liebling captures this ordinary valor with a compassion devoid of sentimentality, judgment, or manipulation.<br>Titled after Carl Sandburg's poetic epic, The People, Yes gathers together more than 100 of Liebling's most indelible images. From the stoic purity of a Shaker community to the vibrancy of unbowed old age; from the stark hubbub of 1940s New York City to the wistful solitude of Emily Dickinson's Amherst; from the infirmary to the handball court; from light to dark and surprise to shock, then back again - Liebling applauds the essential dignity and integrity with which even the humblest among us confront our lives.<br>With stills from Liebling's influential documentary films, and enriched by the photographer's own notes, The People, Yes pays homage - long overdue - to one of our finest practitioners and teachers of film and photography.</p><p>Jerome Liebling's black and white and color images provide candid and startling posed shots of people and environments who battle with their circumstances. Enjoy images which evoke reflection and cultural speculation; from 1940s New York City to shocking photos of cadavers and inmates in a state hospital in the 1960s. -- <i>Midwest Book Review</i></p><h2>Custer and the Little Bighorn The Man, The Mystery, The Myth</h2><p>On June 25, 1876, George Armstrong Custer and his famed U.S. Seventh Cavalry attacked an encampment of Lakota and Cheyenne Indians. By the close of the day, the Battle of the Little Bighorn was over and Civil War hero Custer was dead, along with more than 200 of his men. It was a shocking, unexpected defeat for the dashing one-time Boy General; a magnificent victory for Sitting Bull, Crazy Horse, and their warriors--although it became a last gasp for the Indians' way of life. <p>The battle is over, but even now, 125 years later, Custer's Last Stand still fascinates and horrifies us, continuing to stir controversy and spark vigorous debate. </p><p>"Custer and the Little Bighorn" is the first major illustrated book to examine the life of this complex figure and this equally complex battle. Besides being lavishly illustrated--and the first true photographic history of Custer, his Civil War exploits, and his Last Stand--this detailed narrative examines the latest, groundbreaking research and archaeology of the most widely analyzed battle in our nation's history. </p><p>Jim Donovan also examines Custer's life in full, from his childhood and days at West Point through his glorious Civil War achievements and Indian-fighting career to his death on the Little Bighorn.</p></p><p>Jim Donovan is a Custer historian, as well as the author of several other books, including &#34;Dallas: Shining Star of Texas&#34; (Voyageur Press); he is the co-author of &#34;The Dallas Cowboys Encyclopedia.&#34;Custer continues to intrigue us long after the Battle of Little Big Horn. It is not as if startling new revelations issue forth, for the official reports, Indian accounts, and anecdotal accounts of varying reliability have been examined and repeatedly reexamined. Of course, the variable in any new analysis is the interpretation of and weight one gives to the accounts. Donovan is the author of several books, a literary agent, and a longtime Custer buff. Unlike many recent accounts, especially Evan S. Connell's <i>Son of the Morning </i>Star (1984), Donovan restores Custer as the pivotal figure in the chain of events. He devotes substantial space to descriptions of Custer's early life, Civil War exploits, and personality quirks. Donovan sees a direct line of causation between Custer's experiences and character and his defeat at Little Big Horn and diminishes the factors of Indian resistance and the errors of Custer's superiors and subordinates. Still, Donovan's utilization of recent time-motion studies and his reinterpretation of various Indian accounts lead him to interesting but hardly definitive conclusions. <i>Jay Freeman</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

I&#x2019;d reckoned without his long-range radar. I&#x2019;d been hoping to get away with it, but I&#x2019;m caught red-handed. Twenty-five pairs of eyes turn round, waiting for my answer. &#x2018;Brains&#x2019; has been caught out. Axelle Vernoux and L�a Germain stifle laughter behind their hands, and a dozen bracelets jingle in delight on their wrists. If only I could disappear a hundred miles under the earth, right down to the lithosphere, that would be convenient. I loathe presentations. I loathe talking in front of the class. I feel like a huge crack has opened beneath my feet, but nothing&#x2019;s moved, everything is stuck in slow motion, nothing&#x2019;s falling in. I wish I could faint right here and now. Just be struck down. Drop dead. There I&#x2019;d lie, spreadeagled in my Converse Allstars, and Mr Marin would take his chalk and write on the blackboard: &#x2018;Here lies Lou Bertignac, top of the class, but silent and a loner&#x2019;.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x2018;. . . I was going to put my name down.&#x2019;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x2018;Good. What&#x2019;s your topic?&#x2019;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x2018;The homeless.&#x2019;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x2018;That&#x2019;s rather general. Can you be a bit more specific?&#x2019;<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Lucas is smiling at me. His eyes are huge. I could drown in them, or disappear, or let the silence swallow up Mr Marin and the whole class. I could take my Eastpak and leave without a word, the way Lucas does. I could apologise and say that I haven&#x2019;t a clue, I just said the first thing that came into my head. I&#x2019;ll go and see Mr Marin at the end of the lesson and explain that I can&#x2019;t do it, a presentation in front of the whole class is simply beyond me. I&#x2019;m sorry, but I&#x2019;ll get a doctor&#x2019;s note if I have to: &#x2018;constitutionally unfit for any sort of presentation&#x2019;, all stamped and everything, and I&#x2019;ll be let off. But Lucas is looking at me, and I can tell that he&#x2019;s waiting for me to get myself out of this, that he&#x2019;s rooting for me, he&#x2019;s thinking that a girl like me can&#x2019;t make a fool of herself in front of twenty-five students. He&#x2019;s got his fist clenched. Any higher and he&#x2019;d be brandishing it in the air, like football supporters encouraging their team. But suddenly the silence feels heavy, like we&#x2019;re in church.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x2018;I&#x2019;m going to follow the journey of a homeless girl, her life, erm . . . her story. I mean . . . how she ended up on the streets.&#x2019;<br>&nbsp;<br>A buzz goes through the rows. There&#x2019;s whispering.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x2018;Very good. That&#x2019;s an excellent subject. Figures show that every year more and more women run away, and at a younger and younger age. What documentary sources are you planning to use, Miss Bertignac?&#x2019;<br>&nbsp;<br>I&#x2019;ve nothing to lose. Or else so much that you couldn&#x2019;t count it on the fingers of one hand, or even ten, there is so much.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x2018;Erm . . . interviews. I&#x2019;m going to interview a young homeless woman. I met her yesterday and she&#x2019;s agreed.&#x2019;<br>&nbsp;<br>Thoughtful silence.<br>&nbsp;<br>On a pink sheet of paper, Mr Marin notes my name and the subject of my presentation. &#x2018;I&#x2019;ll put you down for 10th December. That will give you time to do some background research.&#x2019; He goes over the basic rules: don&#x2019;t take more than an hour, provide a socio-economic analysis, give examples . . . His voice tails off. Lucas&#x2019;s hand unclenches. I&#x2019;ve got transparent wings, I&#x2019;m flying above the tables. I close my eyes, I am a tiny speck of dust, an invisible particle, weightless as a sigh. The bell rings. Mr Marin dismisses us, and as I&#x2019;m putting away my things and getting my jacket on, he calls me over.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x2018;Miss Bertignac, a word, if I may.&#x2019;<br>&nbsp;<br>There goes my break. He&#x2019;s done this to me before &#x2013; a word by his reckoning equals a thousand for the rest of us. The others are hanging back, keen to hear. I wait and look down at my feet. My lace is undone as usual. How the hell can I have an IQ of 160 and not be able to tie my shoelaces?<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x2018;You should be careful. With your interviews, I mean. Don&#x2019;t meet unsuitable people. Perhaps your mother or father should go along with you.&#x2019;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x2018;Don&#x2019;t worry. It&#x2019;s all sorted.&#x2019;<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>My mother hasn&#x2019;t been out of the flat in years and my father cries secretly in the bathroom. That&#x2019;s what I should have told him.<br>&nbsp;<br>Then, with a single stroke of his pen, Mr Marin would have crossed me off his list.<br><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i></p><h2>League of Extraordinary Gentleman Volume 4: The Tempest, The</h2><p>After an epic twenty-year journey through the entirety of human culture - the biggest cross-continuity &#39;universe&#39; that is conceivable - Alan Moore and Kevin O&#39;Neill conclude both their legendary League of Extraordinary Gentlemen and their equally legendary comic-book careers with the series&#39; spectacular fourth and final volume, The Tempest. Tying up the slenderest of plot threads and allusions from the three preceding volumes, The Black Dossier, and the Nemo trilogy into a dazzling and ingenious bow, the world&#39;s most accomplished and bad-tempered artist-writer team use their most stylistically adventurous outing yet to display the glories of the medium they are leaving; to demonstrate the excitement that attracted them to the field in the first place; and to analyse, critically and entertainingly, the reasons for their departure. Opening simultaneously in the panic-stricken headquarters of British Military Intelligence, the fabled Ayesha&#39;s lost African city of Kor and the domed citadel of &#39;We&#39; on the devastated Earth of the year 2,996, the dense and yet furiously-paced narrative hurtles like an express locomotive across the fictional globe from Lincoln Island to modern America to the Blazing World; from the Jacobean antiquity of Prospero&#39;s Men to the superhero-inundated pastures of the present to the unimaginable reaches of a shimmering science-fiction future. With a cast-list that includes many of the most iconic figures from literature and pop culture, and a tempo that conveys the terrible momentum of inevitable events, this is literally and literarily the story to end all stories. Originally published as a six-issue run of unfashionable, outmoded and flimsy childrens comics that would make you appear emotionally backward if you read them on the bus, this climactic magnum opus also reprints classic English super-team publication The Seven Stars from the murky black-and-white reaches of 1964.

Visit her at SusanMallery.com.UNTIL 6:45 ON THAT Thursday morning, women had always loved Reid Buchanan.<p> </p><p>They'd started leaving notes in his locker long before he'd figured out the opposite sex could be anything but annoying. During his sophomore year of high school, his hormones had kicked in and he'd become aware of all the possibilities. Over spring break of that year, Misty O'Connell, a senior, seduced him in her parents' basement on a rainy Seattle afternoon, during an MTV<i> Real World</i> marathon.</p><p> </p><p>He'd adored women from that moment on and they had returned his affection. Until today, when he casually opened the morning paper to see his picture next to an article with the headline: Fame, absolutely. Fortune, you bet. But good in bed? Not so much.</p><p> </p><p>Reid nearly spit out his coffee as he jerked to his feet and stared at the page. He blinked, then rubbed his eyes and read the headline again.</p><p> </p><p>Not good in bed? NOT GOOD IN BED? "She's crazy," he muttered, knowing the author had to be a woman he'd dated and dumped. This was about revenge. About getting back at him by humiliating him in public. Because he <i>was</i> good in bed, dammit. Better than good.</p><p> </p><p>He made women scream on a regular basis. They clawed his back--he had the scars to prove it. They stole into his hotel room at night when he was on the road, they begged, they followed him home and offered him anything if he would just sleep with them again.</p><p> </p><p>He was better than good, he was a god!</p><p> </p><p>He was also completely and totally screwed, he thought as he sank back into his chair and scanned the article. Sure enough, the author had gone out with him. It had been one night of what she described as nearly charming conversation, almost funny stories from his past and a so-so couple of hours naked. It was all couched in "don't sue me" language. Things like "Just one reporter's opinion" and "Maybe it's just me, but..."</p><p> </p><p>She'd also claimed he regularly blew off charity events and kids in need--neither of which was true. He couldn't blow off what he never agreed to do. And that was his standard rule--not to get personally involved in anything, including benefits.</p><p> </p><p>He studied the name of the reporter, but it meant nothing. Not even a whisper of a memory. There wasn't a picture, so he grabbed his laptop and went online to the paper's Web site. Under the bio section he found a photo.</p><p> </p><p>He studied the average-looking brunette and had a vague recollection of something. Okay, yeah, so maybe he'd slept with her, but just because he couldn't remember what had happened didn't mean it hadn't been incredible.</p><p> </p><p>But along with the fuzzy memories was the idea that he'd gone out with her during the playoffs, when his former team had been fighting for a chance to make the World Series and he'd been back in Seattle, in his first year of retirement. He'd been bitter and angry about being out of the game. He might also have been drunk.</p><p> </p><p>"I was thinking about baseball instead of her. So sue me," he muttered as he read the article again.</p><p> </p><p>Deep, soul-shriveling embarrassment chilled him. Instead of calling him a bastard to all of her friends, this woman had chosen to humiliate him in public. How the hell was he supposed to fight back? In the courts? He'd been around long enough to know he didn't have a case, and even if he did, how was he supposed to win? Parade a bunch of women around who would swear he made the earth move just by kissing them?</p><p> </p><p>While he kind of liked that idea, he knew it wouldn't make a difference. He'd been a famous baseball player once, and there was nothing the public liked more than to see the mighty fall.</p><p> </p><p>His friends would read this. His family would read this. Everyone he knew in Seattle would read it. He could only imagine what would happen when he walked into his restaurant, the Downtown Sports Bar today.</p><p> </p><p>At least it was local, he thought grimly. Contained. He wouldn't have to deal with hearing from his old baseball buddies.</p><p> </p><p>The phone rang. He grabbed it. "Hello?"</p><p> </p><p>"Mr. Buchanan? Reid? Hi. I'm a producer here at <i>Access Hollywood.</i> I was wondering if you'd like to make a comment on the article in the Seattle paper this morning. The one about--"</p><p> </p><p>"I know what it's about," he growled.</p><p> </p><p>"Oh, good." The young woman on the other end of the phone giggled. "How about an interview? I could have a crew there this morning. I'm sure you want to tell your side of things."</p><p> </p><p>He hung up with a curse. <i>Access Hollywood? </i>Already?</p><p> </p><p>The phone rang again. He pulled the plug and thought about throwing it against the wall, but the damn phone wasn't responsible for this disaster.</p><p> </p><p>His cell rang. He hesitated before picking it up. The caller ID showed a familiar number. A friend from Atlanta. He exhaled with relief. Okay, this call he could take.</p><p> </p><p>"Hey, Tommy. How's it going?"</p><p> </p><p>"Reid, buddy. Have you seen it? The article? It's everywhere. Total bummer. And for the record, dude--too much information."</p><p> </p><p>IF LORI JOHNSTON HAD believed in reincarnation, she would have wondered if she'd been a general, or some other kind of tactical expert in one of her past lives. There was nothing she liked more than taking a few unrelated elements, mixing them together and creating the perfect solution to a problem.</p><p> </p><p>This morning she had to deal with hospital equipment arriving the day <i>after</i> it was supposed to and a catering service delivery with every single entr�e wrong. In her free time, she had her new patient to meet and safely deliver home, assuming the ambulance driver wasn't late. Where other people would be screaming and making threats, Lori felt energized. She would meet this challenge as she met all others and she would be victorious.</p><p> </p><p>The delivery men finished assembling the state-of-the-art hospital bed and stepped back for her inspection. She stretched out on the mattress to check for bumps and low spots. What might just be annoying to someone healthy could be impossible to endure when one had a broken hip.</p><p> </p><p>When the mattress passed inspection, she worked the controls.</p><p> </p><p>"There's a squeak when I raise the bed," she said.</p><p> </p><p>"Can you fix that?"</p><p> </p><p>The men shared an exasperated glance, but she didn't care. Trying to get comfortable while in pain was bad enough, but an annoying noise could make things worse.</p><p> </p><p>Next she checked out the bedside table on wheels, which was fine, as were the wheelchair and the walker.</p><p> </p><p>While the workmen dealt with the squeak, Lori hurried into the massive kitchen where the catering staff sorted through the meals they'd brought.</p><p> </p><p>"The chili?" a woman in a white uniform asked.</p><p> </p><p>"Has to go." Lori pointed to the list she'd posted on the refrigerator. "This is a woman in her seventies. She's had a heart attack and surgery on a broken hip. She's on medication. I said tasty, but not spicy. We want to encourage her to eat, but she may still have stomach issues from all the medication. She doesn't need to lose weight, so that's not a problem. Healthy, tempting dishes. Not chili, not sushi, nothing fancy."</p><p> </p><p>She'd been so specific on the phone, too, she thought with minor exasperation.</p><p> </p><p>Still, she would prevail and when the details were handled, she would stop at Dilettante Chocolates for a little something. Chocolate always brightened her day.</p><p> </p><p>"You could beat them. That would get their attention."</p><p> </p><p>That voice. Lori didn't have to turn around to know who was standing in the doorway of the kitchen. They'd only met once, at her interview.</p><p> </p><p>During the twenty-minute session, she discovered it was possible to be desperately attracted to someone she despised. Everything about him was burned into her brain, including the sound of his voice. For a moment, it made her consider a lobotomy.</p><p> </p><p>She braced herself for the impact of the dark, knowing eyes, the handsome-but-just-shy-of-too-handsome face and the casual slouch that should have annoyed the heck out of her, but instead made her want to melt like a twelve-year-old at a Jesse McCartney concert.</p><p> </p><p>Reid Buchanan was everything she disliked in a man. He'd always had it easy, so nothing had value. Women threw themselves at him. He'd had a brilliant career playing baseball, although she'd never followed sports and didn't know any details. And he'd never once in his entire life bothered with a woman as ordinary as her.</p><p> </p><p>"Don't you have something better to do than just show up and annoy me?" she asked as she turned toward him.</p><p> </p><p>Her reaction to his physical presence was immediate. She found it difficult to breathe, let alone think.</p><p> </p><p>"Annoying you is an unexpected bonus," he said,</p><p> </p><p>"but not the reason I'm here. My grandmother's coming home today."</p><p> </p><p>"I know that. I arranged it."</p><p> </p><p>"I thought I'd stop by to visit her."</p><p> </p><p>"I'm sure knowing you stopped by four hours before she was due home will brighten her day so much that the healing process will be cut in half."</p><p> </p><p>She pushed past him, ignoring the quick brush of her arm against his and the humiliating burst of heat that ignited inside her. She was pathetic. No, she was worse than pathetic--one day she would grow enough to achieve pathetic and that would be a victory.</p><p> </p><p>"She won't be here until this afternoon?" he asked as he followed her back into the library.</p><p> </p><p>"Unfortunately, no. But it was thrilling to see you. So sorry you can't stay."</p><p> </p><p>He leaned against the door frame. He did that a lot. He must know how good he looked doing it, Lori thought grimly. No doubt he practiced at home.</p><p> </p><p>She knew Reid was shallow and selfish and only interested in women as perfect as himself, so why was she attracted to him? She was intelligent. She should know better. And she did...in her head. It was the rest of her that was the problem.</p><p> </p><p>She was a total and complete clich�--a smart, average-looking woman pining after the unobtainable. The bookstores probably contained an entire shelf of self-help books dedicated to her condition. If she believed in self-help books, she could go get herself healed.</p><p> </p><p>As it was...</p></p><h2>Reconstruction After the Civil War (Chicago History of American Civilization)</h2><p>Life in the Southern states in the years immediately following the American Civil War</p><p><p><b>John Hope Franklin </b>(1915&#x2013;2009) was the James B.

DYKINGA&#x2019;s photographs have been published in many magazines and are frequently featured in the literary and photographic journal Arizona Highways. He won the Pulitzer Prize for Feature Photography in 1971. <p>CHARLES BOWDEN is the author of three notable books of essays about the desert and desert life.</p>Straddling the Utah/Arizona border, the Escalante River system and Paria Canyon were among the last areas of the continental United States to be mapped. Dykinga and Bowden, who have teamed up before (The Sonoran Desert, LJ 10/15/92), work well together. Both are residents of Tucson and share a love of the desert Southwest. Dykinga's spectacular color photographs and Bowden's overview of the natural history of the remote and rugged area make for a stunning coffee-table book on a little-known area. Also included is a brief but very beneficial annotated bibliography, most welcome because there is such a dearth of information on the region. Highly recommended for all regional collections.?Tim J.

Lyrical, comic and elegiac, it sings of a land and culture that is disappearing under the assault of change.</p><p>DONALD HALL, poet laureate of the United States from 2006 to 2007, has received the National Book Critics Circle Award, the Los Angeles Times Book Prize in poetry, the Lenore Marshall Award, the 1990 Frost Medal from the Poetry Society of America, and the Ruth Lilly Poetry Prize. He is a member of the American Academy of Arts and Letters.In celebration of New England and the seasons, the poet laureate of New Hampshire records his love of place. The place is a 180-year-old farmland, Eagle Pond, the home of Hall's grandparents and now his home. "There's no reason to live here except for love," writes Hall as he describes the sight of huge Holsteins frolicking or, when impatient for the arrival of spring, he suggests pushing winter "off to a condominium in the keys of Antarctica." This collection of four essays by a close observer of the natural world is a blend of reminiscences, anecdotes and vignettes that capture continuity of family and the quiet delights of rural life in each season. Hall is the author of String Too Short to Be Saved and Fathers Playing Catch With Sons.

He works at the Institute for Educational Policy in Budapest, Hungary, where he is an education fellow. He has also taught at a university in Bulgaria. He has a Ph.D. in linguistics as well as a Ph.D. in education. Who am I? &#34;I am a small child in a big body.&#34;Gr. 1-3. Hussein, who looks about eight years old, lives happily in a Bulgarian village. He enjoys visiting his grandparents, celebrating Muslim holidays, and living in the midst of his loving, extended family. Midway through the story, though, the army arrives and forbids the villagers to speak their language, Romani, in the streets; go outside at night; or pray at the mosque. A policeman destroys the family's identity cards, which are reissued only after they have chosen Christian names. Illustrating the story are clean, expressive ink drawings washed with watercolors in shades of gray and warmed with brighter colors. Both story and illustrations provide a stark contrast between the child's initial contentment within his family and village and the unhappiness that Hussein, his family, and his whole community feel when the shadow of persecution falls over them. In the appended author's note, Kyuchukov explains that when he lived in Bulgaria in the mid-1980s, the Bulgarian government persecuted minorities and insisted that the one million Muslims living there choose Christian names. Until then, the author's name was Hussein. Written from a child's perspective in simple language and short sentences, this unusual picture book does an excellent job of showing the personal cost of political oppression in terms that are accessible. This book may be disturbing to preschoolers. Still, parents and teachers of older children may welcome the chance to introduce the story of Hussein, a Muslim boy whose joys, comforts, concerns, and fears are universal though firmly set in a particular place and time. <i>Carolyn Phelan</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

And that's just the beginning, as Bryson treks through sunbaked deserts and up endless coastlines, crisscrossing the "under-discovered" Down Under in search of all things interesting.<p> Bryson, who could make a pile of dirt compelling--and yes, Australia <i>is</i> mostly dirt--finds no shortage of curiosities. When he isn't dodging Portuguese man-of-wars or considering the virtues of the remarkable platypus, he visits southwest Gippsland, home of the world's largest earthworms (up to 12 feet in length). He discovers that Australia, which began nationhood as a prison, contains the longest straight stretch of railroad track in the world (297 miles), as well as the world's largest monolith (the majestic Uluru) and largest living thing (the Great Barrier Reef). He finds ridiculous place names: "Mullumbimby Ewylamartup, Jiggalong, and the supremely satisfying Tittybong," and manages to catch a cricket game on the radio, which is like </p><blockquote>listening to two men sitting in a rowboat on a large, placid lake on a day when the fish aren't biting; it's like having a nap without losing consciousness. It actually helps not to know quite what's going on. In such a rarefied world of contentment and inactivity, comprehension would become a distraction.</blockquote><p> "You see," Bryson observes, "Australia is an interesting place. It truly is. And that really is all I'm saying." Of course, Bryson--who is as much a travel writer here as a humorist, naturalist, and historian--says much more, and does so with generous amounts of wit and hilarity. Australia may be "mostly empty and a long way away," but it's a little closer now. <i>--Rob McDonald</i></p>"What the indefatigable, keenly observant Bryson did a few years back for the Applachian Trail with A Walk in the Woods... he does now for the generally undiscovered land Down Under."<br>&#x2014;<i> Chicago Tribune</i><br><br>"Vastly entertaining...

The author has termed it &#34;A Two-Lap Book&#34; because it&#39;s designed to be read aloud by two people sitting close together; a person with Alzheimer&#39;s and his or her caregiver or loved one. Like a children&#39;s picture book, it uses straightforward language and cheerful, engaging illustrations. Unlike a children&#39;s book, the topics relate to adult life experiences and the illustrations are of older people. The Sunshine on My Face encourages conversations by evoking thoughts of past experiences and current pleasures. In her introduction, the author explains that it can be read to the person with Alzheimer&#39;s, by the person with Alzheimer&#39;s, or in an alternating fashion. The author also recommends that the caregiver ask questions related to the text and illustrations to elicit responses from the person with dementia. This book is an inexpensive and easy-to-use tool for facilitating meaningful communication between adults with dementia and their caregivers/loved ones. It can be used as frequently or infrequently as the caregiver desires.</p><p>You won't find a simpler way to joyfully interact with someone with Alzheimer's disease, dementia, or other memory impairment. Sit down together, open <b>The Sunshine on My Face</b> across both laps, and begin reading and talking. A Two-Lap Book&#x2122; is the perfect way for family and friends to visit with a loved one or for caregivers to provide a more personal touch. Open to a favorite picture ... read it aloud from start to finish ... or select just a page or two to spark a conversation. <p>While memory-impairing disease such as Alzheimer's gradually strip away communication skills, <b>The Sunshine on My Face</b> brings alive remaining abilities and lets you re-connect in meaningful ways. The easy-to-read words and colorful pictures relate to most people's lives, present and past. Use them to inspire intergenerational exchanges with children, encourage physical closeness, maintain reading skills, or provide a calming diversion. A Two-Lap Book's appeal is universal and timeless.</p>With a master&#39;s degree in Clinical Practices (psychology), Lydia Burdick&#39;s career has been in human resources.

Whether openly and actively or in subtle, subliminal ways, these objects talk to us, and we have come to expect interaction with them. Contemporary designers, besides giving objects form and function, write their initial scripts--the foundation for useful and satisfying conversations. Talk to Me focuses on projects that involve such direct interaction--including interfaces, websites, video games, devices and tools, and information systems--as well as installations that establish practical, emotional, or even sensual connections to cities, companies, governmental institutions, or other individuals. The featured objects range in date from the late 1980s to today, with particular attention given to the last five years and projects currently in development. Organized thematically,<i> Talk to Me</i> introduces design practices that are increasingly crucial to our world and demonstrates how rich and deep the influence of design will be on our future.</p><p></p><h2>The Iceberg Hermit</h2><p>Shipwrecked in 1757 on an iceberg in the Arctic seas with only an orphaned polar cub for companionship, seventeen-year-old Allan begins a seemingly hopeless struggle for survival.</p><p></p><h2>Misshapes</h2><p>&#x201c;...a low-ceilinged, sweaty, black box of a room is filled with people of every color, sexual-orientation, height, weight, dress-sense (or non-sense) imaginable.

Living hermit-like in the same Midlands town for his entire life, he supposedly refuses contact with the outside world while creating his strange, dense comics, fiction, and performance art. While Moore did declare himself a wizard on his fortieth birthday and claims to have communed with extradimensional beings, reticence and seclusion have never been among his eccentricities. On the contrary, for long stretches of his career Moore seemed to be willing to chat with all comers: fanzines, industry magazines, other artists, newspapers, magazines, and personal websites. Well over one hundred interviews in the past thirty years serve as testimony to Moore's willingness to be engaged in productive conversation.<br><br><i>Alan Moore: Conversations, </i>nominated for an Eisner award,&nbsp;includes ten substantial interviews, beginning with Moore's first published conversation, conducted by <i>V for Vendetta</i> cocreator David Lloyd in 1981. The remainder cover nearly all of his major works, including <i>Watchmen</i>, <i>V for Vendetta</i>, <i>Swamp Thing</i>, <i>Marvelman</i>, <i>The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen</i>, <i>Promethea</i>, <i>From Hell</i>, <i>Lost Girls</i>, and the unfinished <i>Big Numbers</i>.<br><br>While Moore's personal life and fraught business relations are discussed occasionally, the interviews chosen are principally devoted to Moore's creative practices and techniques, along with his shifting social, political, and philosophical beliefs. As such, <i>Alan Moore: Conversations</i> should add to any reader's enjoyment and understanding of Moore's work.</p><p>Conversations with the brilliant and eccentric comics writer<b>Eric L.

But ELF&#x2019;s communiqu� on the action went beyond the radical group&#x2019;s customary brief. Drawing connections between the harms facing the myriad animals who make their home in the trees and the struggles for social justice among ordinary human beings resisting exclusion and marginalization, the dispatch declared, &#x201c;all oppression is linked, just as we are all linked,&#x201d; and decried the &#x201c;patriarchal nightmare&#x201d; in the form of &#x201c;techno-industrial global capitalism.&#x201d; </p><p>In <i>Total Liberation</i>, David Naguib Pellow takes up this claim and makes sense of the often tense and violent relationships among humans, ecosystems, and nonhuman animal species, expanding our understanding of inequality and activists&#x2019; uncompromising efforts to oppose it. Grounded in interviews with more than one hundred activists, on-the-spot fieldwork, and analyses of thousands of pages of documents, websites, journals, and zines, <i>Total Liberation </i>reveals the ways in which radical environmental and animal rights movements challenge inequity through a vision they call &#x201c;total liberation.&#x201d; In its encounters with such infamous activists as scott crow, Tre Arrow, Lauren Regan, Rod Coronado, and Gina Lynn, the book offers a close-up, insider&#x2019;s view of one of the most important&#x2014;and feared&#x2014;social movements of our day. At the same time, it shows how and why the U.S. justice system plays to that fear, applying to these movements measures generally reserved for &#x201c;jihadists&#x201d;&#x2014;with disturbing implications for civil liberties and constitutional freedom. </p><p>How do the adherents of &#x201c;total liberation&#x201d; fight oppression and seek justice for humans, nonhumans, and ecosystems alike? And how is this pursuit shaped by the politics of anarchism and anticapitalism? In his answers, Pellow provides crucial in-depth insight into the origins and social significance of the earth and animal liberation movements and their increasingly common and compelling critique of inequality as a threat to life and a dream of a future characterized by social and ecological justice for all. <br></p></p><p><p>David Naguib Pellow is professor and Don A.

To survive the forces arrayed against them, they&#x2019;ll first have to survive one another.</p> <strong>Barry Eisler on <em>Fault Line</em></strong><br><br> <em>Fault Line</em>, my first standalone, introduces military assassin Ben Treven, and my previous six books were a series centering around freelance assassin John Rain. <em>Fault Line</em> includes some pretty explicit sex, and the Rain series has its fair share, too. I think we have enough data now to be confident all these assassin stories with lots of sex in them are not just a coincidence. I get asked often what's behind these recurring elements. Here are a few thoughts on the matter.<br> <p>I&#x2019;m not sure exactly what draws me to characters like Rain and Ben. I think it&#x2019;s that, on the one hand, they&#x2019;re like you and me. They&#x2019;re not sociopaths; they&#x2019;re normal. And yet they&#x2019;re not normal, because they can do--and live with--acts that would crush a normal psyche. I guess I&#x2019;m drawn to the idea that a person can transcend--commit the ultimate transgression, in fact--without being punished for it. An ability like that would be an almost god-like kind of power, wouldn&#x2019;t it? Raskolnikov without the guilt. Ahab without the catastrophe.</p> <p>And yet these men aren&#x2019;t free of consequences--there is a &#x201c;cost of it,&#x201d; as a Vietnam vet friend who&#x2019;s taught me a lot puts it. That cost, and the way these men shoulder it, is something else that fascinates me, and that I try to reflect in my books. It's not just Rain grappling with the weight of what he's done; it's how it effects his ability to have a relationship with a woman--even a fellow professional like Delilah. And the wall Ben feels between men like himself and civilians creates a painful barrier between him and Sarah Hosseini--a barrier that will be put under tremendous pressure by their mutual attraction.</p> <p>Okay, now sex...</p> <p>There are three general ways to get to know someone&#x2019;s character: time, stress, and sex. In a novel, you don&#x2019;t have time, meaning you need an accelerant, and that leaves you with sex or stress. Violence is one of the most stressful experiences we humans can face, which is why violence can be such a powerful tool in stories. But sex is also enormously revealing, which is why the biblical euphemism that Abraham &#x201c;knew&#x201d; Sarah is so apt. Also, sex can be an incredibly powerful pivot. Sex changes everything. Remember when John Cusack and Ione Skye finally make love in <em>Say Anything</em>? Cusack then tries to pretend that it doesn&#x2019;t matter that much, and Lili Taylor says to him something like, &#x201c;Yes it does! It changes everything. Decades could go by without you seeing each other... and then, when you&#x2019;re in your sixties, you might bump into each other, and you&#x2019;ll say, 'Hi, how are you?' and she&#x2019;ll say, 'Fine, how are you?,' but what you&#x2019;ll really be thinking is, &#x2018;We had sex!&#x2019;&#x201d;</p> <p>Which is why I had so much of a blast with the buildup to what happens in <em>Fault Line</em> and with its culmination. These are characters caught for a variety of reasons between powerfully conflicting feelings of antagonism and attraction. They know they shouldn&#x2019;t, they even tell themselves they don&#x2019;t want to... and yet of course they do. What would happen to two people with feelings like that, pressurized by shared danger, enhanced by distrust, catalyzed by violence? Not going to tell you here... you&#x2019;ll have to read the book to find out. <em>--Barry Eisler</em></p> <p>(Photo � Charles Bush)</p>Barry Eisler spent three years in a covert position with the CIA&#x2019;s Directorate of Operations, then worked as a technology lawyer and startup executive in Silicon Valley and Japan, earning his black belt at the Kodokan International Judo Center along the way.

For the moment, the room was quiet, the only sound was of chalk moving on slate boards. By rights the children should have been writing in notebooks, but Miss Slade had taken spare slates from the lower standards and used them for rough work. &#x201c;Then you �don&#x2019;t have to worry about perfection, which as we know �doesn&#x2019;t exist,&#x201d; she told her pupils. She caught the eye of Emmanuel Hart and frowned at him.<br><br>&#x201c;How many times must I remind you, Emmanuel? The mind is like a muscle and must be exercised else it grow flabby and inert.&#x201d;<br><br>The boy bent his head immediately to the task of long division. He was a big boy, too old to still be in the fourth standard, but he had missed a lot of school and his reading and writing was barely at the level of the younger children. In a different classroom he would have been either the bully or the butt of ridicule. Not here. Miss Slade, without ever resorting to the cane, ran a tight, disciplined ship. She was strict about what she called the rules of order, which she&#x2019;d established on the first day of the term. No talking when there was work to be done; only one voice at a time when there was a question-�and-�answer period; absolutely no tormenting of other children. Any infraction of these rules and the offending child, almost always one of the boys, was sent to the Desk of Thoughtfulness, which was right under her nose. Here he had to sit and reflect on his behaviour while all around him the class enjoyed the games and competitions that Miss Slade used to liven up her lessons. &#x201c;Learning should be the most fun you ever have,&#x201d; she told her pupils. And so she made it. On her desk was a large jar full of brightly coloured boiled sweets. The winner of the competition could choose one. But it was not just the succulent bribery of raspberry drops that won the children&#x2019;s devotion, even though that helped a great deal. What they came to respect most was Miss Slade&#x2019;s justice. She dispensed praise and occasional scoldings with an absolutely even hand whether it was to a hopeless case like Emmanuel Hart or to Mary, the clever, exquisitely dressed daughter of Councillor Blong. One or two of the girls, already too prissy to be saved, disliked and mistrusted her, but the others loved her.<br><br>This was Miss Slade&#x2019;s third year of teaching at Sackville Street School and her fourth placement. Although her pupils �didn&#x2019;t know it, her contract was precarious. She was far too radical a teacher for the board&#x2019;s taste, and if she �hadn&#x2019;t consistently produced such excellent results, she would have been dismissed long ago.<br><br>She waited a moment longer, enjoying the <i>put, put</i> sound of the chalk on the slates. Then she clapped her hands.<br><br>"Excellent. There is nothing quite as fine as the silence of the intelligent mind at work. What is it that makes so much noise? Hands up if you know the answer.&#x201d;<br><br>Every arm shot up, hands waving like fronds.<br><br>&#x201c;Good. I would expect you to know the answer to that as I have said it innumerable times. Who �hasn&#x2019;t answered a question lately? Benjamin Fisher, you.&#x201d;<br><br>The skinny boy&#x2019;s face lit up. &#x201c;The most noise in the brain comes from the rattle of empty thoughts, Miss Slade.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yes, of course. You can get a sweet later. Now, wipe off your slates, everybody, and put them in your desks.&#x201d;<br><br>There was a little flurry of activity, desk lids lifted, as the children did as she asked.<br><br>&#x201c;Monitors, open the windows wide, if you please.&#x201d;<br><br>Florence Birrell and Emmanuel Hart got up promptly and went to push up the window sashes. Cold air poured into the classroom, which was hot and stuffy. The large oil heater in the centre of the room dried out the air. The girls who were sitting closest to the windows wrapped their arms in their pinafores for warmth while the boys remained stoic.<br><br>&#x201c;Good! Stand beside your desks, everybody, and assume your positions for cultivation of the chest.&#x201d;<br><br>The children stood in the aisles, their heels pressed together, toes turned out at an angle.<br><br>&#x201c;Remember now, your weight must be forward on the balls of your feet. Let me see. Rise up.&#x201d;<br><br>One or two of the boys deliberately lost their balance, which gave them an excuse to flail their arms and grab on to the desk beside them.<br><br>&#x201c;George Strongithorn, stop that. You will sit out the exercise in the Desk of Thoughtfulness if you misbehave again. You are quite capable of standing on your toes. All right, children, you may assume your correct position once more.&#x201d;<br><br>Miss Slade began to walk up and down, inspecting her pupils. She had her cane pointer in her hand but not to whack at any child, merely to correct.<br><br>Benjamin&#x2019;s older sister, Agnes Fisher, who was directly in front of the open window, shivered violently. She was wearing only a thin cotton jersey underneath her pinafore.<br><br>&#x201c;Agnes, come to the front. It&#x2019;s warmer out of the air.&#x201d;<br><br>Miss Slade faced the class. &#x201c;Now, all together. Inhale . . . and exhale as you say the word <i>far</i>. Whispers please. <i>Farrr</i>.&#x201d;<br><br>There was a soft sighing throughout the room.<br><br>&#x201c;Twice more. Joseph, for goodness sake, your mouth should be closed, not catching flies.&#x201d;<br><br>A giggle ran through the ranks.<br><br>Miss Slade, whose chest was well cultivated, lead the way. &#x201c;Inhale through the right nostril only. And exhale through the left nostril.&#x201d;<br><br>Henry Woolway had a bad cold and blew out some snot as he exhaled. He wiped it away with his sleeve. Without comment Miss Slade handed him a clean handkerchief from her pocket.<br><br>The children continued to breathe, first through one nostril then the other, puny chests thrust out and upward.<br><br>&#x201c;All right, we will pause for a moment. Isaiah, you are still prone to making your shoulders do all the work. That is wrong. It is the lower chest that must rise.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Sorry, Miss Slade. My chest bone hurts if I breathe in too deep.&#x201d;<br><br>Isaiah had a persistent dry cough.<br><br>She tapped hard on her own chest with her two fingers. &#x201c;This is what you must do every day without fail, Isaiah. Firm percussion for five minutes. Then splash cold water on your neck and chest, followed by a dry warm towel. Within three weeks, we should see some improvement.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yes, ma&#x2019;am.&#x201d;<br><br>There were four younger children in Isaiah&#x2019;s family and the closest he got to water in the morning was a damp rag that his mother made him whisk around the face and ears of the two next down. She �didn&#x2019;t seem to notice whether he did the same to himself. Miss Slade read his face correctly.<br><br>&#x201c;On second thoughts, Isaiah, we&#x2019;ll do the exercise when you come to school and I will be able to supervise.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yes, ma&#x2019;am.&#x201d;</p><h2>Veniss Underground</h2><p>Jeff VanderMeer&#x2019;s last book, City of Saints &amp; Madmen, explored the limits of literary fantasy, garnering raves from critics, including a starred review in Publishers Weekly. Now, with Veniss Und</p><p>Jeff VanderMeer is the author of two short story collections, <i>City of Saints and Madmen</i> and <i>A Secret Life,</i> and one novel, VENISS UNDERGROUND. He has also edited anthologies <i>Leviathan 1, 2</i>, and <i>3</i>, and is the co-editor of <i>The Thackery T. Lambshead Pocket Guide to Eccentric &amp; Discredited Diseases.</i> He is a World Fantasy Award winner and Philip K. Dick award finalist.CHAPTER 1<br><br>Let me tell you why I wished to buy a meerkat at Quin's Shanghai Circus. Let me tell you about the city: <i>The city is sharp, the city is a cliche performed with cardboard and painted sparkly colors to disguise the empty center--the hole.</i><br><br>(That's mine--<i>the words</i>. I specialize in holoart, but every once in a chemical moon I'll do the slang jockey thing on paper.)<br><br>Let me tell you what the city means to me. So you'll understand about the meerkat, because it's important. Very important: Back a decade, when the social planners ruled, we called it Dayton Central. Then, when the central government choked flat and the police all went freelance, we started calling it Veni<i>ss</i>--like an adder's hiss, deadly and unpredictable. Art was Dead here until Veni<i>ss</i>. Art before Veni<i>ss</i> was just Whore Hole stuff, street mimes with flexi-faces and flat media.<br><br>That's what the Social Revolutions meant to me--not all the redrum riots and the twisted girders and the flourishing free trade markets and the hundred-meter-high ad signs sprouting on every street corner. Not the garbage zones, not the ocean junks, not the under-level coups, nor even the smell of glandular drugs, musty yet sharp. No, Veniss brought Old Art to an end, made me dream of suck-cess, with my omnipresent, omnieverything holovision.<br><br>Almost brought <i>me</i> to an end as well one day, for in the absence of those policing elements of society (except for pay-for-hire), two malicious thieves--nay, call them what they were: Pick Dicks--well, these two pick dicks stole all my old-style ceramics and new-style holosculpture and, after mashing me on the head with a force that split my brains all over the floor, split too. Even my friend Shadrach Begolem showed concern when he found me. (A brooding sort, my friend Begolem: no blinks; no twitches; no tics. All economy of motion, of energy, of time. Eye e, the opposite of me.) But we managed to rouse an autodoc from its wetwork slumber and got me patched up. (Boy, did that hurt!)<br><br>Afterward, I sat alone in my apartment/studio, crying as I watched nuevo Westerns on a holo Shadrach lent me. All that work gone! The faces of the city, the scenes of the city that had torn their way from my mind to the holo, forever lost--never even shown at a galleria and not likely to have been, either. Veniss, huh! The adder defanged. The snake slithering away. When did anyone care about the real artists until after they were dead? And I was as close to Dead as any Living Artist ever was. I had no supplies. My money had all run out on me--plastic rats deserting a paper ship. I was as much a Goner as the AIs they'd murdered to restore Order, all those Artistic Dreams so many arthritic flickers in a holoscreen. (You don't have a cup of water on you, by any chance? Or a pill or two?)<br>I think I always had Artistic Dreams.<br><br>When we were little, my twinned sister Nicola and I made up these fabric creatures we called cold pricklies and, to balance the equation, some warm fuzzies. All through the sizzling summers of ozone rings and water conservation and baking metal, we'd be indoors with our make-believe world of sharp-hard edges and diffuse-soft curves, forslaking the thirst of veldt and jungle on the video monitors.<br><br>We were both into the Living Art then--the art you can touch and squeeze and hold to your chest, not the dead, flat-screen scrawled stuff. Pseudo-Mom and Pseudo-Dad thought us wonky, but that was okay, because we'd always do our chores, and because later we found out they weren't our real parents. Besides, we had true morals, true integrity. We knew who was evil and who was good. The warm fuzzies always won out in the end.<br><br>Later, we moved on to genetic clay, child gods creating creatures that moved, breathed, asked for attention with their mewling, crying tongues. Creatures we could destroy if it suited our temperament. Not that any of them lived very long.<br><br>My sister moved away from the Living Art when she got older, just as she moved away from me. She programs the free market now.<br>So, since Shadrach certainly wouldn't move in to protect me and my art from the cold pricklies of destruction--I mean, I couldn't go it alone; I had this horrible vision of sacrificing my ceramics, throwing them at future Pick Dicks because the holo stuff wouldn't do any harm of a <i>physical nature</i> (which made me think, hey, maybe this holo stuff is Dead Art, too, if it doesn't impact on the world when you throw it)--since that was Dead Idea, I was determined to go down to Quin's Shanghai Circus (wherever that was) and "git me a meerkat," as those hokey nuevo Westerns say. A meerkat for me, I'd say, tall as you please. Make it a double. In a dirty glass cage. (Oh, I'd crack myself up if the Pick Dicks hadn't already. Tricky, tricky pick dicks.)<br>But you're probably asking how a Living Artist such as myself--a gaunt, relatively unknown, and alone artiste--could pull the strings and yank the chains that get you an audience with the mysterious Quin.<br><br>Well, I admit to connections. I admit to Shadrach. I admit to tracking Shadrach down in the Canal District.<br><br>Canal District--Shadrach. They go together, like <i>Volodya </i>and <i>Sirin</i>, like Ozzie and Elliot, Romeo and Juliard. You could probably find Shadrach down there now, though I hardly see him any more on account of my sister Nicola. That's how I met Shadrach, through Nicola when they shared an apartment.<br><br>You see, Shadrach lived below level for his first twenty-five years, and when he came up the first place they took him to after orientation was the Canal District. "A wall of light," he called it, and framed against this light, my sister Nicola, who served as an orientation officer back then for peoples coming above ground. A wall of light and my sweet sister Nicola, and Shadrach ate them both up. Imagine: living in a world of darkness and neon for all of your life and coming to the surface and there she is, an angel dressed in white to guide you, to comfort you. If you had time, I'd tell you about them, because it was a thing to covet, their love, a thing of beauty to mock the cosmetics ads and the lingerie holos . . . <br><br>Anyway, ever since the space freighters stopped their old splash 'n' crash in the cool-down canals, the Canal District has been the hippest place in town. Go there sometime and think of me, because I don't think I'll be going there again. Half the shops float on the water, so when the oceangoing ships come in with their catch and off-load after decon, the eateries get the first pick. All the Biggest Wigs eat there. You can order pseudowhale, fiddler, sunfish, the works. Most places overlook the water and you can find anything there--mechanicals and Living Art and sensual pleasures that will leave you quivering and unconscious. All done up in a pallet of Colors-Sure-to-Please. Sunsets courtesy of Holo Ink, so you don't have to see the glow of pollution, the haze of smog-shit-muck. Whenever I was down, there I would go, just to sit and watch the Giants of Bioindustry and the Arts walk by, sipping from their carafes of alkie (which I don't envy them, rotgut seaweed never having been a favorite of mine).<br><br>And so I was down, real down (more down than now, sitting in a garbage zone and spieling to you), and I wanted a talk with Shadrach because I knew he worked for Quin and he might relent, relinquish, and <i>tell me</i> what I wanted to know.<br><br>It so happened that I bumped into Shadrach in a quiet corner, away from the carousing and watchful eye of the Canal Police, who are experts at keeping Order, but can never decide exactly which Order, if you know what I mean, and you probably don't.<br><br>We still weren't alone, though--parts merchants and debauched jewelried concierge wives and <br>stodgy autodocs, gleaming with a hint of self-repair, all sped or sauntered by, each self-absorbed, self-absorbing.<br><br>Shadrach played it cool, cooler, coolest, listening to the sea beyond, visible from a crack in our tall failing walls.<br><br>"Hi," I said. "Haven't seen you since those lousy pick dicks did their evil work. You saved my skin, you did."<br><br>"Hello, Nick," Shadrach replied, looking out at the canals.<br><br>("Hello, Nick," he says, after all the compli- and condiments I'd given him!)<br><br>Shadrach is a tall, muscular man with a tan, a flattened nose from his days as courier between city-states--the funny people gave him that--and a dour mouth. His clothes are all out-of-date, his boots positively reeking of antiquity. Still thinks he's a Twenty-seventh-Century Man, if you know what I mean, and, again, you probably don't. (After all, you are sitting here in a garbage zone with me.)<br><br>"So, how're things with you?" I said, anticipating that I'd have to drag him kicking and screaming to my point.<br><br>"Fine," he said. "You look bad, though." No smile.<br><br>I suppose I did look bad. I suppose I must have, still bandaged up and a swell on my head that a geosurfer would want to ride.<br><br>"Thanks," I said, wondering why all my words, once smartly deployed for battle, had left me.<br><br>"No problem," he said.<br><br>I could tell Shadrach wasn't in a talking mood. More like a Dead Art mood as he watched the canals.<br><br>And then the miracle: He roused himself from his canal contemplation long enough to say, "I could get you protection," all the while staring at me like I was a dead man, which is the selfsame stare he always has. But here was my chance.<br><br>"Like what, you shiller?" I said. "A whole friggin' police unit all decked out in alkie and shiny new bribes?"<br><br>He shrugged and said, "I'm trying to help. Small fish need a hook to catch bigger fish."<br><br>"Not a bad turn of phrase," I said, lying. "You get that from looking into the water all damn day? What I need is Quin."<br><br>Shadrach snorted, said, "You are desperate. An invite to Quin?" He wouldn't meet my gaze directly, but edged around it, edged in between it. "Maybe in a million years you'd build up the contacts," he said, "the raw money and influence."<br><br>I turned away, because that stung. The robbery stung, the not-being-able-to-sell-the-art stung. Life stung. And stunk.<br><br>"Easy for you, Shadrach," I said. "You're not a Living Artist. I don't need an invite. Just give me the address and I'll go myself to beg a meerkat. Anything extra I do on my own."<br><br>Shadrach frowned, said, "You do not know what you are asking for, Nicholas." I thought I saw fear in him--fear and an uncharacteristic glimpse of compassion. "You will get hurt. I know you--and I know Quin. Quin isn't in it for the Living Art. He's in it for other reasons entirely. Things I don't even know."<br><br>By now I'd begun to break out in the sweats and a moist heat was creeping up my throat, and, hey, maybe I'd had too much on the drug-side on the way down, so I put a hand on his arm, as much to keep my balance as anything.<br><br>"For a friend," I said. "For Nicola. I need a break or I'm going to have to go below level and live out my days in a garbage zone." (And look where I am today? In a garbage zone. Talking to you.)<br><br>Bringing up my sister was low--especially because I owed her so much money--but bringing up below level was lower still. Shadrach still had nightmares about living underground with the mutties and the funny people, and the drip-drip-drip of water constantly invading the system.<br><br>He stared at me, the knuckles of his hands losing color where they clutched the rail. Did he, I hoped, see enough of my sister in me?<br><br>But I'm not heartless--when I saw him like that, the hurt showing as surely as if they'd broken up a day ago, I recanted. I said, "Forget it, my friend. Forget it. I'll work something else out. You know me. It's okey-dokey."<br><br>Shadrach held me a moment longer with his gray, unyielding eyes, then he sighed and exhaled so that his shoulders sagged and his head bowed. He examined his stick-on sandals with the seriousness of a podiatect.<br><br>"You want Quin," he said, "you first have to promise me this is a secret--for life, God help you. If it gets out Quin's seeing someone like you, there'll be a whole bunch of loonies digging up the city to find him."<br><br><i>Someone like you</i> hurt, but I just said, "Who am I going to tell? Me, who's always borrowing for the next holo? People avoid me. I am alone in the world. Quin could get me close to people."<br><br>"I know," he said, a bit sadly, I thought.<br><br>"So tell me," I said. "Where is it?"<br><br>"You have to tell Quin I sent you," he said, and pointed a finger at me, "and all you want is to buy a meerkat."<br><br>"You that budsky-budsky with Quin?" I said, incredulous--and a little loud, so a brace of Canal policemen gave me a look like I was luny-o.<br><br>"Keep your voice down," Shadrach said. Then: "Go west down the canalside escalators until you see the Mercado streetlight. There's an alley just before that. Go down the alley. At the end, it looks like a dead ender because there are recycling bins and other debris from the last ten centuries. But don't be fooled. Just close your eyes--it's a holo, and when you're through, there's Quin's, right in front of you. Just walk right in."<br><br>"Thank U, Shadrach," I said, heart beating triple-time fast. "I'll tell Nicola that you gave her the time of day."<br><br>His eyes widened and brightened, and a smile crossed his face, fading quickly. But I knew, and he knew I knew.<br><br>"Be careful," he said, his voice so odd that shivers spiraled up my back. He shook my hand. "Quin's a little . . . strange," he said. "When it's over, come and see me. And remember, Nicholas--don't--don't dicker with him over the price to be paid."<br><br>Then he was gone, taking long, ground-eating strides away from me down the docks, without even a good-bye or a chance to thank him, as if I was somehow tainted, somehow no good. It made me sad. It made me mad. Because I've always said Shadrach was Off, even when Nicola dated him.<br><br>Shadrach and Nicola. I've had relationships, but never the Big One. Those loving young lovers strolling down by the drug-free zones, those couples coupling in the shadow of the canals, they don't know what it is to be desperately in love, and perhaps even Nicola didn't know. But I thought Shadrach would die when she left him. I thought he would curl up and die. He should have died, except that he found Quin, and somehow Quin raised him up from the dead.</p><h2>DK Eyewitness Travel Guide Switzerland</h2><p><p>Ski the Alps, explore the idyllic countryside, and take in the alpine scenery when you travel to Switzerland.

His subtly erotic portraits, richly patterned landscapes and enigmatic allegorical compositions are at once sensuous and refined, while his extravagant, ornamental style verges on abstraction. Obliged to go his own way when he was denied public commissions, Klimt became the leader of the modernists in Vienna, during the tragic final years of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, and was perhaps the greatest portraitist of his age, a landscape painter of dazzling originality and above all the creator of extraordinary decorative schemes. 159 illus., 29 in color.</p><p>Frank Whitford was born in 1941 and educated at Wadham College, Oxford, the Courtauld Institute, London and the Freie Universitat, West Berlin. After a career as a journalist and a cartoonist, he taught at University College London, and then in Cambridge, where he is still attached to Wolfson College. Well known as a broadcaster and lecturer, he was for many years Tutor in Cultural History at the Royal College of Art, London.

With eight chapters of place-setting author introductions, riveting period imagery, and highly detailed explanatory captions, Morgan offers anyone interested in D-Day a fresh look at a campaign that was fought seven decades ago, yet remains the object of unwavering interest to this day.<br><br> While some of these images are familiar, they have been treated anonymously for far too long and haven't been placed within the proper context of time or place. Many others have never been published before. Together, these photographs reveal minute<b> details about weapons, uniforms, and equipment</b>, while simultaneously narrating an intimate <b>human story of triumph, tragedy, and sacrifice</b>.

Award-winning cartoonist Lilli Carr� takes readers on a nocturnal adventure up a mountain, down a hole, and back home for endless bedtime enjoyment.</p></p><p>Lilli Carr� grew up in California and now lives in Chicago, Illinois, where she works as an artist, a filmmaker, and an illustrator. Tippy and the Night Parade is her first book for children.<br><br>As a kid, Lilli always dreamed of having wild animals follow her, but it usually ended up the other way around. Now she likes to take long, wandering walks around the city. No one has ever told her that she sleepwalks, but she often wakes up to find herself in a very messy room, occasionally with a cat on her head.While respectably hardcover and didactically appended with suggestions for reading guidance, "Tippy" uses the paneled art and speech balloons of comics and displays its downtown roots through an offbeat color palette (cantaloupe, chocolate and gunmetal blue), blithe generalization of form and a bed-headed heroine who looks as much the hipster gamin as she does a little girl.<br>&#x2014;The New York Times Book Review<br><br>In her first book for young children, cartoonist Carr� repeats key phrases in the text to help beginning readers...

McCrary's 25 years in the Bureau have yielded over 1000 cases to draw upon. The 10 he describes in the book reveal the strengths and pitfalls of modern criminal investigation.</p><p> McCrary is not afraid to answer the questions most often skirted by the others: what happens at the crime scene, what kind of person does it take to grapple with the serial killers among us, and exactly how do we disarm the enemy?</p></p><p><p>Gregg McCrary is one of the world's most experienced profilers. As a Supervisory Special Agent with the FBI's Behavioral Science Unit, he reported directly to BSU chief John Douglas, and with other experts, developed the Crime Classification Manual, a system for standardizing violent crimes into categories. Since retiring from the FBI in 1995, he has taught forensic psychology at Marymount University and Nova Southeastern University. McCrary continues to consult and provide expert testimony in cases in which crime scene analysis is key, and provides expert commentary to <em>NBC, ABC, CBS,</em> and <em>CNN.</em></p>Many of us may think we know quite a lot about FBI profilers, but, says the former supervisor of the bureau's behavioral science unit, our knowledge comes almost entirely from fictionalized portrayals in films like <i>Silence of the Lambs</i> and television series like <i>Profiler</i>. The truth, he tells us, is rather different from fiction. This book, cowritten with forensic psychology professor Ramsland, puts profiling in the context of a more comprehensive program called Criminal Investigative Analysis. (Some readers may wonder why the FBI gives its behavioral-assessment program a name whose acronym is CIA.) Using actual cases in which he participated, McCrary demonstrates how profiling is but one part of this multifaceted crime-solving program. His explanation of the nuts and bolts of it all is surprisingly lively and will captivate true-crime fans with a yen to know more about profiling and related investigative practices. <i>David Pitt</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

How can such sublime work have been produced by a man who (when we can discern his personality at all) seems so ordinary, so opaque - and occasionally so intemperate? John Eliot Gardiner grew up passing one of the only two authentic portraits of Bach every morning and evening on the stairs of his parents&#39; house, where it hung for safety during the Second World War. He has been studying and performing Bach ever since, and is now regarded as one of the composer&#39;s greatest living interpreters. The fruits of this lifetime&#39;s immersion are distilled in this remarkable book, grounded in the most recent Bach scholarship but moving far beyond it, which explains in wonderful detail the ideas on which Bach drew, how he worked, how his music is constructed, how it achieves its effects - and what it can tell us about Bach the man. Gardiner&#39;s background as a historian has encouraged him to search for ways in which scholarship and performance can cooperate and fruitfully coalesce. This has entailed piecing together the few biographical shards, scrutinising the music, and watching for those instances when Bach&#39;s personality seems to penetrate the fabric of his notation. Gardiner&#39;s aim is &#39;to give the reader a sense of inhabiting the same experiences and sensations that Bach might have had in the act of music-making. This, I try to show, can help us arrive at a more human likeness discernible in the closely related processes of composing and performing his music.&#39; It is very rare that such an accomplished performer of music should also be a considerable writer and thinker about it. John Eliot Gardiner takes us as deeply into Bach&#39;s works and mind as perhaps words can. The result is a unique book about one of the greatest of all creative artists. SIR JOHN ELIOT GARDINER is one of the world&#39;s leading conductors, not only of Baroque music but across the whole repertoire. He founded the Monteverdi Choir and Orchestra, the Orchestre de l&#39;Op�ra de Lyon, the English Baroque Soloists, and the Orchestre Revolutionnaire et Romantique.

He lives in London and Dorset.1<br><br>Under the Cantor&#x2019;s Gaze<br><br>In the autumn of 1936 a thirty-year-old music teacher from Bad Warmbrunn in Lower Silesia suddenly appeared in a Dorset village with two items in his luggage: a guitar and a portrait in oils of Bach. Like old Veit Bach, the founder of the clan, escaping from Eastern Europe as a religious refugee almost four centuries earlier, Walter Jenke had left Germany just as Jews were being banned from holding professional posts. He settled and found work in North Dorset, married an English girl and, with war imminent, looked for a safe home for his painting. His great-grandfather had purchased a portrait of Bach in a curiosity shop sometime in the 1820s for next to nothing. Doubtless he did not know at the time that this was &#x2013; and still is &#x2013; by far the most important Bach portrait in existence. Had Jenke left it with his mother in Bad Warmbrunn, it would almost certainly not have survived the bombardment or the evacuation of Germans from Silesia in the face of the advancing Red Army.<br><br>I grew up under the Cantor&#x2019;s gaze. The celebrated Haussmann portrait of Bach1 had been given to my parents for safekeeping for the duration of the war, and it took pride of place on the first-floor landing of the old mill in Dorset where I was born. Every night on my way to bed I tried to avoid its forbidding stare. I was doubly fortunate as a child in that I grew up on a farm and into a music-minded family where it was considered perfectly normal to sing &#x2013; on a tractor or horseback (my father), at table (the whole family sang grace at mealtimes) or at weekend gatherings, outlets for my parents&#x2019; love of vocal music. All through the war years they and a few local friends convened every Sunday morning to sing William Byrd&#x2019;s Mass for Four Voices. As children my brother, sister and I grew up getting to know a grand miscellany of unaccompanied choral music &#x2013; from Josquin to Palestrina, Tallis to Purcell, Monteverdi to Sch�tz, and, eventually, Bach. Compared to the earlier polyphony, Bach&#x2019;s motets, we found, were a lot more difficult technically &#x2013; those long, long phrases with nowhere to breathe &#x2013; but I remember loving the interplay of voices, with so much going on at once, and that pulsating rhythm underneath keeping everything afloat. By the time I was twelve I knew the treble parts of most of Bach&#x2019;s six motets more or less by heart. They became part of the primary matter in my head (along with folksongs, ribald poems in Dorset dialect and heaven knows what else, stored in my memory) and have never left me.<br><br>Then, during my teens, I came to know some of his instrumental music: the Brandenburg Concertos, the violin sonatas and concertos (with which, as a distinctly average fiddle-player, I often struggled &#x2013; and usually lost &#x2013; between the ages of nine and eighteen, at which stage I switched to the viola), some of the keyboard pieces and several cantata arias for alto, of which my mother was very fond. Even now I cannot hear arias such as &#x2018;Gelobet sei der Herr, mein Gott&#x2019; (&#x2018;The Lord be praised&#x2019;) or &#x2018;Von der Welt verlang ich nichts&#x2019; (&#x2018;I ask nothing of the world&#x2019;) without a lump in my throat, remembering her voice floating across the courtyard from the mill-room. But my early apprenticeship in Bach, the nurturing of a lifelong engagement with his music and a longing to understand the stern Cantor at the top of the stairs, I owe to four remarkable teachers &#x2013; three women and one man &#x2013; who helped to determine the kind of musician I was to become.<br><br>The man was Wilfred Brown, the great English tenor, who visited my school when I was fourteen, singing both the Evangelist and the tenor arias in a performance of Bach&#x2019;s John Passion. I was so captivated that, unpardonable in a principal second violin, at one point I stopped playing altogether and just gawped. As an interpreter of Bach&#x2019;s Evangelist, Bill Brown was nonpareil. His singing was characterised by an extraordinary subtlety of inflection and word-painting, and by a pathos that was inseparable from his own Quaker beliefs and the humility they brought, something I recognised from my mother&#x2019;s Quaker upbringing. Later on he offered to give me singing lessons from the time I was sixteen until I was twenty-two, sometimes travelling to Cambridge to do so and always refusing a fee.<br><br>Imogen Holst, daughter of Gustav and amanuensis to Benjamin Britten, was a regular visitor to my parents&#x2019; home and sometimes led their choral weekends and gave singing lessons to me and my sister. She, I suppose more than any other musician I had encountered at that early stage, stressed the importance of dance in Baroque music. This was so clearly visible in her own interpretation and her way of conducting Bach that someone once filmed her just from the waist downwards while conducting the B minor Mass. To this day, thanks to Imo, I feel that the worst interpretative sin (committed with painful regularity even now) is to plod in Bach; denying or resisting the rhythmical elasticity and buoyancy of his music ensures that its spirit shoots out of the door. In speaking touchingly of her father, she stressed the indispensability of music, that it was a part of life that &#x2018;can&#x2019;t be done without&#x2019;.<br><br>Letting Bach dance was one lesson well learnt; the other was how to make him &#x2018;sing&#x2019;. This sounds so obvious and so much easier than it is in practice. Not all of Bach&#x2019;s melodies are singer-friendly or melodious in the way that, say, Purcell&#x2019;s or Schubert&#x2019;s are. Often angular, the phrase-lengths uncomfortably long, peppered with little curlicue flourishes and ornaments, they require a lot of purpose, underpinned by iron breath-control, before they can truly sing. And that applies not just to the vocal lines, but to the instrumental ones as well. This I learnt from my violin teacher, Sybil Eaton, a pupil of the celebrated Greek violinist and musicologist Minos Dounias. Sybil certainly &#x2018;sang&#x2019; when she played the fiddle, but, through her inspirational teaching and sheer love of Bach, she was also able to help her pupils to take melodic wing, whether we were playing concertos, solo partitas or obbligato parts to arias from the Passions or the cantatas.<br><br>The person who crystallised all these ideas for me was Nadia Boulanger, justly recognised as the most celebrated teacher of composition in the twentieth century. When she accepted me as a student in Paris in 1967, she had just turned eighty and was partially blind, but with all her other faculties in tip-top order. Her way of teaching harmony was founded on Bach&#x2019;s chorales, which she regarded as models of how to establish a beautiful polyphony &#x2013; with each voice being accorded equal importance while still playing a different role in the four-way conversation, now advancing, now retreating: contrapuntally conceived harmony, in other words. She insisted that the freedom to express yourself in music, whether as a composer, conductor or performer, demanded obedience to certain laws and the possession of unassailable technical skills. One of her favourite sayings was &#x2018;Talent [by which I think she meant technique] without genius is not worth much; but genius without talent is worth nothing whatsoever.&#x2019;<br><br>Confined for two years to an unvarying diet of harmony and counterpoint exercises and solf�ge (the particularly nasty but effective French system of ear-training), I metaphorically kicked and scratched like a cornered animal. On at least one occasion, from sheer frustration, Hindemith&#x2019;s Elementary Training for Musicians ended up in the gutter &#x2013; thrown out of the window of my bed-sit in the 4th arrondissement. But I owe her a colossal debt. She had a way of challenging every preconception as well as a knack of exposing one&#x2019;s shortcomings, technical or otherwise, quite mercilessly. She saw something in me that I did not even see in myself. It was only after I had left the boulangerie that I realised that what had seemed like torture at the time was actually an act of kindness, equipping me to avoid certain professional embarrassments in the future. And, despite her severity, she was extraordinarily generous, even bequeathing to me her unique collection of transcriptions of Renaissance and Baroque music (from Monteverdi to Rameau), including scores and parts of her favourite Bach cantatas, all meticulously annotated &#x2013; some of my most treasured possessions.<br><br>How was I to translate this painfully acquired theory and ear-training into actual sound when standing in front of a choir and orchestra? Luckily by this stage (1967&#x2013;8), while I was a student in Paris and Fontainebleau, from time to time I had access to an &#x2018;instrument&#x2019; in London &#x2013; the Monteverdi Choir. It had all started back in 1964 when I was in my third year at Cambridge. My tutor, the social anthropologist Edmund Leach, authorised me to take a year off from the History tripos to sieve through the possible directions my life might take and, crucially, to find out whether I really had it in me to become a full-time musician. Ostensibly I was there to read Classical Arabic and medieval Spanish; in practice the task I set myself was to perform Monteverdi&#x2019;s 1610 Vespers, a work that, although I had first heard it as a child, was still very little known and had never before been performed in Cambridge. Despite the dual handicap of my relative inexperience as a conductor and my little formal musical training up to that point, I had set my heart on conducting one of the most challenging works in the choral repertoire. I spent the best part of that year studying the original part-books on microfilm and, with the encouragement of the Professor of Music, Thurston Dart, preparing a new performing edition. I also ended up doing everything involved in planning a public performance in King&#x2019;s College Chapel &#x2013; from assembling and training the choir and orchestra, to having the tickets printed and putting out the chairs.<br><br>Vibrant colour contrasts and passionate declamation seemed to me to be the hallmark of this music. The test for me was whether I could draw any of that from a group of student singers trained in a totally different tradition. To that extent the Monteverdi Choir started life as an anti-choir &#x2013; in reaction to the well-mannered euphony and blend which characterised the celebrated chapel choir at King&#x2019;s in my day, whose mantra was &#x2018;Never louder than lovely&#x2019;. Their style was summed up for me by a performance, at Boris Ord&#x2019;s memorial service, of Jesu, meine Freude &#x2013; that most extended and interpretatively challenging of Bach&#x2019;s motets &#x2013; sung in English with effete and lip-wiping prissiness: &#x2018;Jesu . . .&#x2019; (pronounced Jeez-ewe), followed by a huge comma and expressive intake of breath, &#x2018;. . . priceless treasure&#x2019; (pronounced trez-ewer). I seethed. How had the wonderfully exultant music that I had known since I was a child come to be treated in such a precious, etiolated way? Was this not like adding a layer of face powder and a few beauty spots to the dour old Cantor&#x2019;s portrait?<br><br>My first attempt at performing Monteverdi&#x2019;s masterpiece took place in March 1964 with some of the same performers. It fell a long way short of the ideals I had set for it, yet people who heard it were encouraging, even enthusiastic. For me it was not just a test of skill, but the epiphany I had been searching for. The decision was made: better to follow an overwhelming passion, even one that would need years of study and practice and with absolutely no guarantee of success, than to pursue safer career paths for which I might already have had the rudimentary technical qualifications. I was encouraged to persist in my rebellion against the vestiges of Victorian performance and to find a more permanent footing for the Monteverdi Choir. My starting-point, then as now, was to bring passion and expressivity to the vocal music of the Baroque, and, as appropriate, to the nationality, period and personality of the composer. In a typical programme, such as we gave in the Cambridge Festival in 1965, devoted to music by Monteverdi, Sch�tz and Purcell, we set out to enable listeners to hear the idiosyncratic approach of each master sung in the original language, to follow each composer as he experimented with music based on recitation over a figured bass line and revelled in the new expressive range it offered. It was heady stuff, and our efforts were doubtless crude and exaggerated; but at least they did not sound half-baked or indistinguishable from Anglican pieties during a wet November Evensong.<br><br>I was desperately short of working models. Nadia Boulanger no longer conducted. Nor did Thurston Dart, from whose Sherlock Holmes-like approach to musicology I had learnt a great deal in the postgraduate year that I studied with him after he moved to King&#x2019;s College, London. I did, however, have the luck to observe the distinguished keyboard virtuoso and conductor George Malcolm. George knew how to draw dazzling performances of a most un-English ardour from his choir at Westminster Cathedral, and, amazingly, he took the trouble to travel up to Cambridge to hear my first Vespers performance. Here was a true master and, I felt, a kindred spirit, whose approbation and encouragement at that stage made all the difference to me, although he had virtually given up choral conducting. <br><br>Then, at a friend&#x2019;s invitation, I went to hear Karl Richter conduct his Munich Bach Choir in 1967. Richter was acclaimed as the foremost exponent of Bach&#x2019;s choral music at the time, but even his muscular LP recordings of cantatas hadn&#x2019;t prepared me for the oppressive volume and sheer aggression of the motet Singet dem Herrn as delivered by seventy lusty Bavarians from the gallery of the Markuskirche. This was a world apart from the mincing &#x2018;holy, holy&#x2019; approach of King&#x2019;s or the Bach Choir in London in their annual Good Friday Matthew Passion outing at the Royal Festival Hall, but hardly more inspiriting. Nor did Richter&#x2019;s thunderous approach to the Goldberg Variations next day on a souped-up Neupert harpsichord, given in the Musikhochschule (Hitler&#x2019;s former residence), do much to restore my faith. Here, as in most of the live performances or recordings that I had access to, Bach came over as grim, sombre, po-faced, lacking in spirit, humour and humanity. Where was the festive joy and zest of this dance-impregnated music? A few years later I heard a performance of the John Passion under Benjamin Britten, a very fine conductor who combed out the separate strands of Bach&#x2019;s elaborate counterpoint before my ears, revealing the work&#x2019;s drama from the inside. Yet, even so, to me it sounded fatally &#x2018;English&#x2019;. I felt a similar disappointment when I first heard Mozart played in Salzburg and Vienna in 1958: the elegant surface of the playing seemed to overlay and disguise the turbulent emotional inner life of the music.</p><h2>God&#39;s Human Face: The Christ-Icon</h2><p>The principal editor of the <i>Catechism of the Catholic Church</i>, presents the sources of meditation on the mystery of God's human face from the great Masters of early Christianity.<br><br>Artists and theologians have meditated upon the mystery of God's human countenance and tried to express it.

The Judy Garland Show immediately became the most exciting -- and explosive -- event of the 1963-64 television season, unleashing a storm of controversy that had still not ceased at the time of publication.<br><br>The Judy Garland Show seemed sabotaged from the very beginning and became a single-season casualty. CBS plunged the program into chaos -- tampering with its format, hiring and firing staff members, and refusing to move the series away from NBC's Bonanza, then the top-rated show on the air. At the same time, Garland was locked in a high-stakes power struggle among network executives, show staff members, an estranged husband, and her managers, Freddie Fields and a pre-Indecent Exposure David Begelman.<br><br>Lavishly illustrated with dozens of rare, previously unpublished photographs, Rainbow's End -- written by a former television news journalist -- draws upon candid interviews with nearly one hundred key people involved in the day-to-day production of the Garland series: intimates within her personal entourage, backstage crew members, CBS insiders, choreographers, dancers, writers, producers, directors, and series regular Jerry Van Dyke, along with Norman Jewison, George Schlatter, Gary Smith, Mort Lindsey, and Bob Mackie.<br><br>Many of the great talents who appeared on the show share in this book their affectionate and often humorous reminiscences. Here also are Judy's three children, Liza Minnelli, Lorna Luft, and Joseph Luft, who offer their loving, intimate, and uniquely insightful memories of The Judy Garland Show in rich detail for the first time.<br><br>Rainbow's End is the extraordinary on-camera and behind-the-scenes saga of the singer's last dazzling moment at the top that was The Judy Garland Show -- a so-called television "failure" that in later years was "rediscovered" and lauded with tremendous critical and popular acclaim.</p><p>The last major effort of Judy Garland's career was the Judy Garland Show , which aired on CBS for 26 weeks in 1963-64. Its commercial failure has often been attributed to the star's insecurity, her problems with substance abuse, and her difficulty in dealing with the pressures of producing a weekly series. In this well-researched, objective work, TV journalist Sanders portrays Garland as a demanding individual but blames the network for the show's demise. He describes network infighting and monumental ego battles and provides almost minute-by-minute details of how each show was put together. Garland fans will appreciate Sanders's senstive yet straightforward treatment of this troubled superstar--and look forward with interest to the release of the shows on videotape.

But when a disturbed stalker plunges Kathleen into a real-life nightmare, her only hope is Johnny -- and a love that can bring two hearts through every battle, especially the one within.</p><p>Setting: Rawlings, Oklahoma, 1945<p> Sensuality: 7</p><p> Johnny Henry returns from World War II to a boisterous hero's welcome, but the only face he really wants to see is that of his estranged wife, Kathleen. Craving assurance that he is alive and well, Kathleen watches him from afar, never realizing that he searches the crowd for her. After the parade is over, Johnny struggles to rebuild his life and deal with his love for Kathleen--a love that he is convinced is now forbidden. For her part, Kathleen's heart is breaking as she's often thrown into Johnny's company in the small ranching community of Rawlings, Oklahoma. The tragedy that tore the couple apart before Johnny shipped out for the Pacific still haunts them both. And the depth of misunderstanding that lies between them seems insurmountable until Kathleen's life is threatened and Johnny is forced to confront his fears.</p><p> Garlock offers a keen insight into the mores and character of 1940s middle America in this post- World War II novel.

He was a mighty pulpit orator who thundered against sin, awakening the consciences of his hearers, and then gently leading them to the Savior. He was also a great teacher, who would teach a class of around 500 young men after Sunday night service, instructing them in the way of the Lord more perfectly. In the later part of Dr. Whyte&#x2019;s ministry, one of his pet topics was prayer. Luke 11:1 was a favorite text and was often used in conjunction with another text as the basis for his sermons on this subject. The sermons printed here represent only a few of the many delivered. But each one is deeply instructive, powerful and convicting. From the Preface: Nobody else could have preached these sermons; after much reading and re-reading of them that remains the most vivid impression. There can be few more strongly personal documents in the whole literature of the pulpit. . . . When all is said, there is something here that defies analysis&#x2014;something titanic, something colossal, which makes ordinary preaching seem to lie a long way below such heights as gave the vision in these words, such forces as shaped their appeal. We are driven back on the mystery of a great soul, dealt with in God&#x2019;s secret ways and given more than the ordinary measure of endowment and grace. His hearers have often wondered at his sustained intensity; as Dr. Joseph Parker once wrote of him: &#x201c;many would have announced the chaining of Satan for a thousand years with less expenditure of vital force&#x201d; than Dr. Whyte gave to the mere announcing of a hymn.</p><p></p><h2>Museum of Accidents</h2><p><p>"Rachel Zucker may be Generation X's likeliest heir to the confessional legacy of Sylvia Plath, Louise Gl�ck, and Sharon Olds."&#x2014;<i>The Believer</i></p><p>Rending the terrorizing forces of modern existence from abstraction and placing them directly in our laps, <i>Museum of Accidents</i> is a brutally honest epic of domestic proportions.</p><p><b>Rachel Zucker</b> is the author of three collections of poetry and co-editor of <i>Women Poets on Mentorship: Efforts and Affections</i>.

A graduate of Yale and the Iowa Writer&#39;s Workshop, Zucker has taught at several institutions, including NYU and Yale. She currently lives in NYC with her husband and three sons, and is a certified labor doula.Starred Review. This forth collection of poems by Zucker (<i>The Bad Wife Handbook</i>) furthers her project to portray the dark underside of marriage and parenthood in 16 mostly long poems that are as formally wild as they are self-conscious and emotionally searing. Zucker's subject is not an unhappy marriage, but an average one, which, she wants to make clear, is full of as much pain, fear, lust and hopelessness as the fabled unions of some of her confessional forebears. There is happiness, too, but that's not the province of this book, in which romance can be reduced to a formula (Thursday: we have sex (husband and I) lights on), and a poem recounts how an audience member at a poetry reading says, after hearing the author read about her young son, Someday, he'll grow up and read that and you'll pay. In another, a fellow poet advises the next time you feel yourself going dark/ in a poem, just don't, and see what happens, yielding one of the oddest happy poems around. Zucker's willingness to put her own pain on display may frighten or even disgust some readers, but most will be grateful to find themselves less alone in their own everyday suffering. This is a book for all who seek what Zucker calls the antidote for despair, however elusive it may be. <i>(Oct.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

He had already experienced racism as a soldier in the Free French Army, for which he had volunteered and in whose ranks he saw combat during the liberation of France. In Algeria, he came into contact with the Front de Liberation National whose ruthless struggle for an independent Algeria was met with quite exceptional violence by the French Army. Fanon identified completely with the FLN and soon became a marked man. Forced to flee Algeria when he resigned his post, Fanon subsequently worked with the FLN as a propagandist and ambassador.<br><br>Based on extensive and original research, this is the most compete and objective biography of Fanon yet written. It sweeps away the myths that have grown up around him and reveals Fanon to be a complex figure, infinitely more interesting than the theorist of anti-colonial violence celebrated by the left in the 60s. Macey shows Fanon to have been a man formed in the context of the French Caribbean, with its history of slavery and racism, and traces Fanon's intellectual career as a political thinker and psychiatrist with great care, setting it against the background of post-war French culture.<br><br>David Macey has done justice for the first time to the extraordinary life of a complex figure, flawed in some respects but fundamentally a humanist committed to the eradication of colonialism, a man whose angry and eloquent writings are still of fierce relevance today.<br></p><p><b>David Macey</b> has translated some twenty books from the French. He is the author of <i>Lacan in Context</i>, the acclaimed <i>The Lives of Michel Foucault</i>, and <i>The Penguin Dictionary of Critical Theory</i>. He lives in Leeds, England.<br>Macey (Lacan in Context), British translator, biographer and critic, is one of the foremost English-language chroniclers of the distinctive postwar French hybrids of psychological, political and historical thought. His Lives of Michel Foucault is so far the definitive biographical study of the prodigious thinker, and this biography of a fervent anti-colonialist revolutionary may be even more important for the role it could play in bringing Fanon's writings out of the American academy and back into common discussion. Fanon (1925-1961) was a native of Martinique, more than 10 years the junior of the radical "negritude" poet (and current mayor of Fort-de-France) Aim&#x201a; C&#x201a;saire, who was one of his high school teachers. By the time Fanon's brilliant, blistering diatribe Black Skin, White Masks appeared from a Paris publisher in 1952, Fanon was a psychiatrist; he had been part of a Moroccan-based resistance unit during the war, and had found the white left irredeemably bigoted. (Fanon described the book as a study in "language and aggressivity.") Fanon's colossal shifts of registers (political, medical, poetic, sociological) in the book's phenomenology of racism are well explicated by Macey, who gives nuanced accounts of the African nationalist essays and books that followed (primarily concerning Algeria, where Fanon practiced), and complicates Fanon's advocacy of violence-as-catharsis one of the facets of his work that attracted the radical American left of the '60s. Macey does a terrific job throughout reconstructing the contexts in which Fanon conceived and wrote his works, and the terms with which one might best approach them. The book will be invaluable to scholars, but those looking for an entr&#x201a;e into postwar Francophone literature and its political militancy will find this book an excellent guide to notoriously thorny works, and to their author, who died of cancer soon after his illness was discovered. <p></p><p>Copyright 2001 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p></p><h2>National Lampoon Presents True Facts: the Big Book</h2><p><p>Now, for the first time, fans of <i>National Lampoon's</i> popular True Facts books can enjoy the complete True Facts collection in one hilarious edition.

Their mastery of delicious home-cooked dishes and comfort food makes them the ideal source for this cookbook. Author Pat Tanumihardja has assembled 130 tantalizing dishes from real Chinese fried rice to the classic Filipino Chicken Adobo to the ultimate Japanese comfort dish Oyako donburi. This is hearty food, brightly flavored, equally good to look at and eat. Flavors range from soy and ginger to hot chiles, fragrant curries, and tart vinegars. The author has translated all of the recipes to work in modern home kitchens. Many of them have been handed down from mother to daughter for generations without written recipes, and some appear in tested and written form for the first time. An exhaustive Asian Pantry glossary explains the ingredients, from the many kinds of rice and curries to unfamiliar but flavorful vegetables.</p><p>The kitchen goddess is definitely the Asian American grandmother. She is the glue that holds the family together; the keeper of cultural and culinary tradition; the source of all things delicious, pungent, salty, and satisfying. Pull up a chair at the kitchen table and pick up some chopsticks--grandmothers who cook Chinese, Japanese, Filipino, Vietnamese, Korean, Indonesian, Thai, and Indian cuisine are in the kitchen stirring up culinary delights for you. What's your favorite? Crispy Shrimp Rolls or Shiu Mai or a satisfying bowl of Nepalese Nine-Bean Soup? <br><br>To compile the recipes for this gratifyingly expansive cookbook, author Patricia Tanumihardja (whose grandmother hailed from Indonesia) served as cultural historian, recipe transcriber, and surrogate granddaughter. How else could she garner the recipes for such dishes as Water Spinach with Shrimp Paste and Chilies, Pan- Fried Tofu Simmered in Sweet Miso Sauce, or Grandma Yangja's Cabbage Kimchi? These are the authentic dishes you don't necessarily find in restaurants: Steamed Meatballs with Tangerine Peel, Gingered Oxtail Stew, 1-2-3-4-5 Sticky Spareribs, and Clay Pot Lemongrass-Steamed Fish. And if you believe that the noodle was invented by an Asian grandmother, you are ready for a bowl of Pancit (Filipino Fried Noodles) or Ohn No Khauk Swe (Chicken Coconut Noodle Soup). This beautiful culinary tour of Asian American kitchens makes many cultural stops, with a panoply of flavors and a bountiful menu of dishes along the way. So even if you aren't fortunate enough to have an Asian grandmother yourself, double happiness can be yours by sharing and enjoying these enduring recipes."America is a land of immigrants, and Patricia Tanumihardja's soulful work illuminates how Asian women--queens of their family kitchens--enrich our flavorful culinary landscape."--Andrea Nguyen, author of Into the Vietnamese Kitchen and Asian Dumplings<br>"My own first, and lastingly wonderful, impressions of Japan were of obachan (grandmothers); their food and stories continue to nourish me decades later. Thanks to Patricia Tanumihardja's Asian Grandmothers Cookbook, everyone will have a chance to be nurtured by an Asian Granny."&nbsp;--Elizabeth Andoh, author of Washoku: Recipes from the Japanese Home Kitchen</p><h2>George and Matilda mouse and the floating school</h2><p>After a scary encounter with the cat, a class of mice finds a safer location for its school.</p><p>PreSchool-Grade 1-- The baby mice born at the end of George and Matilda Mouse and the Doll's House (S. &amp; S., 1988) are now ready for school. Unfortunately, the cat nearly brings schooling to an end by catching an unwitting student. George not only diverts the cat and saves the young mouse, but also discovers the solution to their dilemma in an overturned garbage can. The mice turn a discarded Noah's ark toy into a three-story floating school, safe from feline intrusions. Buchanan lays the groundwork for this ingenious solution by portraying a toy ark among the children's playthings early in the story. This book about the pair moves faster than the first, both because the text is substantially shorter and because there is more activity and a bit of conflict. Buchanan still has inconsistencies, such as whether the pupils meet by day or night, and the clean, cute, cuddly mice remain sweet but unexciting. They make Jill Barklem's "Brambly Hedge" residents look rugged in comparison. Preschoolers who like dollhouses and miniature toys may enjoy the detail in Buchanan's mouse world, but youngsters who demand action in their stories will likely remain dissatisfied. --Kathy Piehl, Mankato State University, MN<br>Copyright 1991 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Modern Classics Her Lover (belle Du Seigneur) (Penguin Modern Classics)</h2><p>Handsome, worldly and intelligent, Solal holds a position of enviable power in 1930s Geneva. But as Under-Secretary-General of the League of Nations, he has become bitterly disillusioned by international affairs and the self-serving people who surround him. His one hope for redemption is through love - and he embarks on the audacious seduction of Ariane, the beautiful, daydreaming wife of a dull-witted, social-climbing employee of the League. In Her Lover, Albert Cohen created a world humming with the many vivid and eccentric voices of its wonderfully observed characters.

Macunaima, first published in Portuguese in 1928, and one of the masterworks of Brazilian literature, is a comic folkloric rhapsody (call it a novel if you really want) about the adventures of a popular hero whose fate is intended to define the national character of Brazil. <br><br> "Inventive, blessedly unsentimental," as Kirkus Reviews has it, and incorporating and interpreting the rich exotic myths and legends of Brazil, Macunaima traces the hero's quest for a magic charm, a gift from the gods, that he lost by transgressing the mores of his culture. Born in the heart of the darkness of the jungle, Macunaima is a complex of contradictory traits (he is, of course, "a hero without a character"), and can at will magically change his age, his race, his geographic location, to suit his purposes and overcome obstacles. Dramatizing aspects of Brazil in transition (multiracial, Indian versus European, rural versus urban life), Macunaima undergoes sometimes hilarious, sometimes grotesque transformations until his final annihilation and apotheosis as the Great Bear constellation in the heavens.</p><p>Text: English, Portugese (translation)</p><h2>Jesus and the Ossuaries: What Jewish Burial Practices Reveal about the Beginning of Christianity</h2><p><p>In <i>Jesus and the Ossuaries</i>, Craig A.

"Quickly, discreetly, and with a minimum of pain and suffering. Out of consideration for Michael. But I am going to kill her.""What was that?" Eileen said, looking up and blinking at me.I glanced over at my best friend and fellow craftswoman. She had already unpacked about an acre of blue-and-white porcelain and arranged it on her side of our booth. I still had several tons of wrought iron to wrestle into place.I scratched two or three places where my authentic colonial-style linsey-woolsey dress was giving me contact dermatitis. I rolled my ruffled sleeves higher up on my arms, even though I knew they'd flop down again in two minutes; then I hiked my skirts up a foot or so, hoping a stray breeze would cool off my legs."I said I'm going to kill Michael's mother for making us do this craft fair in eighteenth-century costume," I said. "It's absolutely crazy in ninety-degree weather.""Well, it's not entirely Mrs. Waterston's fault," Eileen said. "Who knew we'd be having weather like this in October?"I couldn't think of a reasonable answer, so I turned back to the case I was unpacking and lifted out a pair of wrought-iron candlesticks. Eileen, like me, was flushed from the heat and exertion, not to mention frizzy from the humidity. But withher blond hair and fair skin, it gave the effect of glowing health. I felt like a disheveled mess."This would be so much easier in jeans," I grumbled, tripping over the hem of my skirt as I walked over to the table to set the candlesticks down."People are already showing up," Eileen said, with a shrug. "You know what a stickler Mrs. Waterston is for authenticity."Yes, everyone in Yorktown had long ago figured that out. And Martha Stewart had nothing on Mrs. Waterston for attention to detail. If she'd had her way, we'd have made every single stitch we wore by hand, by candlelight. She'd probably have tried to make us spin the thread and weave the fabric ourselves, not to mention raising and shearing the sheep. And when she finally pushed enough of us over the edge, we'd have to make sure our lynch mob used an authentic colonial-style hemp rope instead of an anachronistic nylon one.Of course, my fellow craftspeople would probably lynch me, too, while they were at it, since I was her deputy in charge of organizing the craft fair. And in Mrs. Waterston's eyes, keeping all the participants anachronism-free was my responsibility. When I'd volunteered for the job, I'd thought it a wonderful way to make a good impression on the hypercritical mother of the man I loved. I'd spent the past six months trying not to make Michael an orphan. Speaking of Michael ..."Where's Michael, anyway?" Eileen asked, echoing my thoughts. "I thought he was going to help you with that.""He will when he gets here," I said. "He's still getting into costume.""He's going to look so wonderful in colonial dress," Eileen said."Yes," I said. "Lucky we don't have a full-length mirror in the tent, or we wouldn't see him for hours.""You know you don't mean that," Eileen said, with a frown. "You're crazy about Michael."I let that pass. Yes, I was crazy about Michael, but I was a grown woman in my thirties, not a starry-eyed teenager in the throes of her first crush. And Michael and I had been together a little over a year. Long enough for me to fully appreciate his many good points, but also long enough to notice a few shortcomings. The thing about costumes and mirrors, for example. And the fact that getting dressed to go anywhere took him two or three times as long as it took me.Not that I complained, usually; the results were always spectacular. But at the moment, I'd have traded spectacular for available to help. I wrestled an eight-foot trellis into position and sat back, panting."Maybe I will wait until he gets here to finish this," I said."But Mrs. Waterston wants us all set up by ten!" Eileen said. She rummaged in the wicker basket she was using instead of a purse, then shot a guilty glance back at me before pulling out her wristwatch."It's 9:30 already," she said, thrusting the watch back out of sight beneath the red- and white-checked fabric lining the basket. Familiar gestures already: the furtive glance to see if anyone who cared--like me, theoretically--was looking before someone pulled out a necessary but forbidden modern object. And then the hasty concealment. Eileen should have figured out by now that as long as nobody else spotted her, I didn't give a damn.Then again, we'd found out this morning that Mrs. Waterston had enlisted a dozen assistants, whom she'd dubbed "the Town Watch." In theory, the watchmen were under my orders, available to help with crowd control and prevent shoplifting. In practice, they were the reason I was running late. I'd spent all morning trying to stop them from harassing variousfrantic craftspeople about using modern tools to set up, and keeping them from confiscating various items they'd decided were "not in period." The crafters had started calling them "the Anachronism Police.""I'm nearly finished with my side," Eileen said. "If you like, I could--"A loud boom interrupted her, seeming to shake the very ground. Both of us jumped; Eileen shrieked; and her pottery rattled alarmingly. We could hear more shrieks and oaths from nearby booths."What on Earth!" Eileen exclaimed, racing over to her table to make sure none of her ethereally delicate cups and vases had broken."Oh, Lord," I muttered. "I thought she was kidding.""Kidding about what?" Eileen asked."What the hell was that, a sonic boom?" shouted Amanda, the African American weaver in the booth across the aisle."The artillery," I shouted back."Artillery?" Eileen echoed."The what?" Amanda asked, dropping a braided rug and trotting over to our booth."Artillery," I repeated. "For the Siege of Yorktown. That's what this whole thing is celebrating, you know--""Yeah, I know," Amanda said. "October 19, 1781. The British finally throw in the towel and surrender to George Washington and the Revolutionary War is over. Whoopty-do. Let freedom ring, except for my people, who had to wait another eighty years. So what's with the sound effects?""Another of Mrs. Waterston's brainstorms," I said. "She hired a bunch of guys to fire a replica cannon to add to the authenticity of the event.""You mean, like a starter's gun to open the fair?" Amanda asked."Demonstrations for the tourists, maybe," Eileen suggested."Actually ..." I said.Another thunderous boom shook the encampment. This time we heard fewer shrieks and more angry yells."Actually," I began again, "she's going to have them firing continuously, to simulate the siege. Washington's troops shelled the British nonstop for a couple of weeks before attacking their entrenchments.""She's going to have them doing that all day?" Eileen asked."Probably all night, too, unless someone can find an obscure county ordinance to stop it." Someone like me, probably. I'd already promised half a dozen townspeople who'd seen the artillery setting up that I'd find a way to silence the cannons at bedtime. Now that the shelling had actually begun, I'd be swamped with complainers any second--and no matter how irate they were, none of them wanted to tackle Mrs. Waterston directly."Bunch of loonies," Amanda muttered.No argument from me."Bad enough I have to dress up like Aunt Jemima," she said, as she returned to her own booth. "And now this.""Oh, but you look ... wonderful," Eileen called. "So authentic!"Amanda looked down at her homespun dress and snorted. She was right, unfortunately. I'd always envied Amanda's stylish urban wardrobe, with its vivid colors and offbeat but sophisticated cuts. I'd never before realized how well her chic outfits camouflaged a slightly plump figure. And when you threw in the cultural associations an African American woman raised in Richmond, Virginia, was bound to have with colonial-era clothing ..."Oh, dear," Eileen murmured. From the sudden crease inher normally smooth forehead, I could tell that the last point had just dawned on her. "This must be awful for poor Amanda! Do you think we should--""Look sharp!" hissed a voice nearby. "Here she comes! Put away your anachronisms!"Copyright � 2001 by Donna Andrews.</p><h2>Entranced</h2><p>Book 2 in <i>The Donovan Legacy</i><p><b>A New York Times Bestseller <br>A #1 New York Times Bestselling Author</b></p><p> He was certainly a fraud, and Mary Ellen Sutherland wasn't about to let him exploit her friend's vulnerability.

Some cower behind the walls of vast citadels, while others hide in forgotten corners, hoping to remain unnoticed. But, in rare souls, the potential for greatness arises. Individuals who will be remembered throughout the ages for their deeds, their names stamped into the annals of history. Some, like Darkoath Warqueen Vedra the Sworn, must do battle with the blood-crazed warriors of Khorne even while deceit and treachery fester&nbsp;at the heart of her forces.

Mr. Elkins lives on Washington&#x2019;s Olympic Peninsula with Charlotte.<br>Physical anthropologist Gideon Oliver, earlier seen in Edgar-winner Old Bones , resumes his forensic sleuthing in this well-intentioned but wordy yarn. Having joined his wife on a professional junket to Alaska, Oliver is Johnny-on-the-spot when the survivors of a 1960 expedition discover bones. The leader, botanist M. Audley Tremaine, returns nearly 30 years later to unveil his book about the ill-fated trek to Tirku Glacier to the one other survivor, Walter Judd, and the relatives of those lost in an avalanche. But the remains of a skull found on the glacier reveal to Oliver that an ice pick had pierced it before the avalanche struck. Though Tremaine ostensibly hangs himself after hearing this news, Oliver suspects the scientist has been murdered. When Tremaine's manuscript and then the skeletal fragments are stolen, Oliver and the FBI have only the memories of Judd and the relatives to work with. The intrepid "skeleton detective" is nevertheless able to wrest the truth about the events on Tirku from its "icy clutches." But the repetitive scientific analysis and an overwrought narrative dull the novel's potential for suspense. <br>Copyright 1990 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Home Decor Sewing Technique Bible</h2><p>The Home D?cor Sewing Technique Bible is the essential reference guide that shows you how to create a range of soft furnishings in your own unique style with a professional flair.

Years later he met photographer Arne Svenson (author of the recent popular volume <i>Chewed</i>) who, intrigued by the obsessive nature and growing size of the collection, began with equal obsession to document individually its more than 1,800 examples. To convey the distinct personality imbued in each monkey by its maker, Svenson photographs them in the manner of classical black-and-white portraiture: flatteringly lit, cropped at the shoulders, eyes to the camera. The first 200 of these sock monkey portraits, reproduced larger than life as full-page duotones, are assembled in this book. Invited contributors, including novelists Jonathan Safran Foer, Neil Gaiman and Dale Peck; entertainers Penn &amp; Teller; and fashion commentators Simon Doonan and Isaac Mizrahi, have interjected short stories inspired by the subject of their favorite sock monkey photograph. The result is an engaging, humorous and at times disturbing reanimation of creatures long relegated to the attic or the back of the closet.</p><p>The dignified tone of the portraits perfectly emphasizes the distinct individuality of each piece and the resonance it has with its creator.<br><br>[Sock Monkeys] triggers sympathies that embarrass the hard-hearted and cause sentimental viewers to gush.</p><h2>Betty Crocker&#39;s Dinner for Two Cookbook</h2><p>Suggests quick, inexpensive, and memorable dinners for two and includes advice on special cooking techniques</p><p></p><h2>Sunderlies Seeking: Book One of Ghattens&#39; Gambit</h2><p>Delighted at the prospect of journeying to the Sunderlies, twins Jenneth and Diccon befriend the ghattens Pw&#39;eek and Kwee, but the trip is overshadowed by suspicious disasters, including a storm at sea that sweeps two of them overboard.

He begins with a group of light but haunting fables, populated by figures like the King, a tiny creature in ermine who has lost his desire to rule, and by the poet&#x2019;s own alter ego, who recounts the fetching mystery of the title poem: &#x201c;I sat on the porch having a smoke / when out of the blue a man and a camel / happened by.&#x201d; The poet has Arctic adventures and encounters with the bearded figure of Death; in his controlled tone, he creates his bold visions and shows us, like a magician, how they vanish in a blink.

Here, this secular poet finds resonance in the bedrock of Christ&#x2019;s language, the actual words that have governed so many generations of thought and belief. As always with Mark Strand, the discovery of meaning in the sound of language itself is an act of faith that enlightens us and carries us beyond the bounds of the rational.</p><p>Mark Strand was born in Summerside, Prince Edward Island, Canada, and was raised and educated in the United States. He is the author of ten earlier books of poems. He is also the author of a book of stories, <i>Mr. and Mrs. Baby</i>, three volumes of translations (of works by Rafael Alberti and Carlos Drummond de Andrade, and of anonymous Quechua lyrics), a number of anthologies (most recently <i>100 Great Poems of the Twentieth Century</i>), and monographs on the contemporary artists William Bailey and Edward Hopper. He has received many honors and grants for his poems, including a MacArthur Fellowship for 1987&#x2013;92, and in 1990 he was chosen Poet Laureate of the United States. In 1993 he was awarded the Bollingen Prize, and in 1999 he won the Pulitzer Prize for <i>Blizzard of One</i>. He lives in New York City and teaches at Columbia University.<b> Man and Camel</b><br><br> On the eve of my fortieth birthday<br><br> I sat on the porch having a smoke<br><br> when out of the blue a man and a camel<br><br> happened by.

Into the desert<br><br> they went and as they went their voices<br><br> rose as one above the sifting sound<br><br> of windblown sand. The wonder of their singing,<br><br> its elusive blend of man and camel, seemed<br><br> an ideal image for all uncommon couples.<br><br> Was this the night that I had waited for<br><br> so long? I wanted to believe it was,<br><br> but just as they were vanishing, the man<br><br> and camel ceased to sing, and galloped<br><br> back to town. They stood before my porch,<br><br> staring up at me with beady eyes, and said:<br><br> &#x201c;You ruined it.

I stood in the long,<br><br> whispering night, waiting for something, a sign, the approach<br><br> of a distant light, and I imagined you coming closer,<br><br> the dark waves of your hair mingling with the sea,<br><br> and the dark became desire, and desire the arriving light.<br><br> The nearness, the momentary warmth of you as I stood<br><br> on that lonely height watching the slow swells of the sea<br><br> break on the shore and turn briefly into glass and disappear . . .<br><br> Why did I believe you would come out of nowhere?

Though supervised by a male priest, the Pontifex Maximus, they had privileges beyond those of most women; like Roman men, they dispensed favors and influence on behalf of their clients and relatives. In 1883, Rodolfo Lanciani, Director of Antiquities for Rome, discovered the first Vestal statues. The recovery of the Vestals&#x2019; house, and the objects contained therein, was an exciting moment in Roman archaeology. Newspapers were filled with details about the huge numbers of sculptures, inscriptions, jewelry, coins, and terracotta figures.<br>Molly M. Lindner examines the sculptural presentation of the Vestal Virgins and investigates what images of long-dead women tell us about their lives. She addresses why these portraits were created, and why they only began to appear in the late first or second century CE&#x2014;much later than portraits of other Roman priestesses and nonimperial women. Lindner sheds light on the distinctions between a Vestal portrait and portraits of other priestesses, and considers why Vestal portraits do not copy each other&#x2019;s headdresses and hairstyles. In addition to the extensive illustrations that complement the text, a catalog of all known Vestal portraits displays historical clues embedded in the hairstyles and facial features of the Vestals and other women of their day. In&nbsp;<i>Portraits of the Vestal Virgins, Priestesses of Ancient Rome</i>, Lindner has given a voice to the long-silent women of these extraordinary marble portraits.&nbsp;</p><p><b>Molly M.

The show&#39;s United States tour began in April 2005 at Emory University&#39;s Michael C. Carlos Museum in Atlanta, Georgia and continues through June 2009. The objects are explained in 12 richly illustrated chapters that deal with various aspects of ancient Egyptian art and material culture: chronology; sculpture; archaeology; sites; weights and measures; daily life; writing; arts and crafts; ceramics; funerary works; tools and weapons; and faience and glass objects. First and foremost, Excavating Egypt... is the story of the Petrie Museum of Egyptian Archaeology, founded through bequest in 1892 by writer Amelia Edwards (1831-1892) at University College London. It was named after Sir William Matthew Flinders Petrie (1853-1942), a professor of Egyptian Archaeology. Edwards&#39; numerous trips to the land of the pharaohs were described in her popular A Thousand Miles Up the Nile (1877); the book introduced British readers to Egypt, its people and ancient monuments.</p><p></p><h2>800 Days on the Eastern Front: A Russian Soldier Remembers World War II (Modern War Studies (Hardcover))</h2><p>During his 800 days of war, Nikolai Litvin fought at the front lines in the ferocious tank battles at Kursk, was wounded three times, and witnessed unspeakable brutalities against prisoners and civilians. But he survived to pen this brief but powerful memoir of his wartime experiences.<br><br>Barely out of his teens, Litvin served for three years in the Red Army on the killing fields of the Eastern Front. His memoir presents an unadorned, candid narrative of the common soldier's lot in Stalin's army. Unlike the memoirs of Russian officers&#x2014;usually preoccupied with large military operations and political concerns&#x2014;this narrative offers a true ground-level view of World War II's deadliest theater. It puts a begrimed human face on the enormous toll of casualties and provides a rare perspective on battles that were instrumental in the defeat of the German army.<br><br>Litvin's varied roles, ranging from antitank gunner at Kursk to heavy machine gunner in a penal battalion to staff driver for the 352nd Rifle Division, offer unique perspectives on the Red Army in World War II as it fought from the Ukraine deep into the German heartland. Litvin documents such significant battles as Operation Kutuzov, Operation Bagration, and the German counterattack on the Narev, while also providing unique personal observations on fording the Dnepr River under enemy fire, the rape of German women by Russian troops, and literally seeing his life pass before his eyes as he watched a Stuka's bomb fall directly on his position. And, because part of his duties involved chauffeuring Red Army generals, he also presents revealing glimpses into their personalities and behaviors.<br><br>Originally written in 1962, with events still fresh in his mind, Litvin's memoir lay unpublished and unseen until translator Stuart Britton and a Russian colleague approached him about publishing it in English. Britton interviewed Litvin to flesh out the details of his original recollection and annotated the resulting work to provide historical context for the campaigns and battles in which he participated. Remarkably free of Soviet-era propaganda, this gem of a memoir provides a view of the war never seen by western readers, including photographs from Litvin's personal collection.<br><br>An invaluable historical document, as well as a remarkable testament of survival, Litvin's memoir offers unique and penetrating insights into the Soviet wartime experience unavailable in any other source.</p><p>"The best memoir to date of a Red Army soldier in World War II. It's also rare in terms of the amount of detail it contains, the accuracy of that detail, and its unabashed candor. Britton skillfully complements Litvin's account by providing essential context and additional valuable information."-David M. Glantz, author of <i>Colossus Reborn: The Red Army at War, 1941-1943</i> <p>"Absorbing and thought-provoking, Litvin's story reveals the perseverance, resourcefulness, and astonishing toughness of the typical Red Army soldier, and is a must-read for anyone interested in the Eastern Front or soldiers' experiences in World War II."-Reina Pennington, author of <i>Wings, Women, and War: Soviet Airwomen in World War II Combat</i></p>Nikolai Litvin is retired and lives in Krasnodar, Russia. Stuart Britton is a freelance writer and translator based in Cedar Rapids, Iowa.</p><h2>Eisenhower vs. Warren: The Battle for Civil Rights and Liberties</h2><p><p><strong>The epic 1950s battle that would shape the legal future of the civil rights movement is chronicled here for the first time.</strong></p> The bitter feud between President Dwight D. Eisenhower and Chief Justice Earl Warren framed the tumultuous future of the modern civil rights movement. Eisenhower was a gradualist who wanted to coax white Americans in the South into eventually accepting integration, while Warren, author of the Supreme Court&#x2019;s historic unanimous opinion in <em>Brown v. Board of Education</em>, demanded immediate action to dismantle the segregation of the public school system. In <em>Eisenhower vs. Warren</em>, two-time <em>New York Times</em> Notable Book author James F. Simon examines the years of strife between them that led Eisenhower to say that his biggest mistake as president was appointing that &#x201c;dumb son of a bitch Earl Warren.&#x201d; This momentous, poisonous relationship is presented here at last in one volume. Compellingly written, <em>Eisenhower vs. Warren</em> brings to vivid life the clash that continues to reverberate in political and constitutional debates today. 8 pages of photographs</p><p>James F. Simon is dean emeritus at New York Law School. He is the author of nine books on American history, law, and politics, and has won the American Bar Association&#x2019;s Silver Gavel Award. He lives in West Nyack, New York.&#x201c;Enjoyably readable, thoroughly researched.... An absorbing book about a saga in American law and politics that remains centrally important.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Lincoln Caplan, <i>New York Times</i></strong><br><br>&#x201c;The most thorough and balanced assessment of the two men&#x2019;s fraught relationship yet written.... Simon is the ideal scholar to undertake this study, having made a career of examining conflicts between the presidency and the Supreme Court. As we anticipate an existential clash between Donald Trump and the justices&#x2015;if Trump attempts to fire Special Counsel Robert Mueller, for instance, or defies an obstruction-of-justice finding&#x2015;Simon&#x2019;s book is highly topical. It also has something to teach us about incremental versus rapid change. The fundamental disagreement it chronicles concerns the pace of social progress.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Michael O'Donnell, <i>The Atlantic</i></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Illuminate[s] an often-overlooked period of legal history at the start of the civil rights movement. . . . Simon is in top form, creating sympathetic portraits of both protagonists, capturing the historical context of Eisenhower&#x2019;s presidency, thoroughly explaining the dynamics of the Warren Court, and, when necessary, looking past Eisenhower&#x2019;s and Warren&#x2019;s professed positions to expose their underlying motives and goals. This balanced account of the bitter relationship between Eisenhower and Warren presents a new lens through which to view the start of the civil rights movement.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>Publishers Weekly</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;A vivid account....Gripping.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Michael Barone, <em>Wall Street Journal</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Many Americans, especially white ones, think of the 1950s with gauzy nostalgia....[<em>Eisenhower vs Warren</em>] offer[s] important corrections to such sentimentalism.... Mr. Simon is an engaging storyteller.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><i>The Economist</i></strong><br><br>&#x201c;A detailed, fine-grained study...As Simon skillfully demonstrates, Eisenhower was far from inert on the subject of racial reform... Warren, too, is written as intriguingly complicated.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>Open Letters Review</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;The two principals&#x2019; individuality, as well as their relationship to one another and to their associate justices, is skillfully and intelligently drawn. This is a cogently written book, especially given the complexity of many of the issues. Simon does great justice to an important segment of a critical period in American history.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>Booklist</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Chief Justice Earl Warren was a bold moralist. President Dwight Eisenhower was a cautious pragmatist. Both men were, in their way and in their time, great leaders. With clear-eyed judiciousness and a subtle feel for the nuances of hard decision-making, James Simon has brought the compelling conflict between these two men to life.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Evan Thomas, author of <em>Ike&#x2019;s Bluff</em> and <em>Being Nixon</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;A lively and accessible synthesis of the existing literature on Eisenhower's and Warren's careers, as well as an incisive analysis of their relationship. Once again James Simon shows his facility for illuminating pairings of celebrated historical figures.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>G. Edward White, David and Mary Harrison Distinguished Professor of Law University of Virginia School of Law</strong><br><br>&#x201c;In <em>Eisenhower v. Warren</em>, James Simon offers a truly masterful telling of the complex relationship between two of the most influential and compelling figures in mid-twentieth century America. Exploring such fundamental issues as racial segregation and McCarthyism, Simon takes us beyond the scenes in the White House, the Congress, and the Supreme Court to reveal with extraordinary intimacy the conflicts, the compromises, and the sometimes shaped antagonisms that shaped one of the most pivotal periods in American history.

In letters, journals, and books, travelers wrote first-hand of exotic lands and beautiful scenery, and of encounters with strange peoples and wildlife.

Chance delivers a powerfully written page-turner about a woman&#39;s struggle to escape the confines of her time, class, and gender. Literary historical fiction is an extremely popular genre, as demonstrated by such bestsellers as Matthew Pearl&#39;s &#34;The Dante Club (Random House, 2/03) and Michael Faber&#39;s &#34;The Crimson Petal and the White (Harcourt, 9/02). Megan Chance is the author of &#34;Susannah Morrow (Warner, 10/02), which captured the extraordinary drama of the Salem witch trials; as well as the historical romance novels &#34;A Season in Eden (Harper, 1999), &#34;The Gentleman Caller (Harper, 1998), &#34;The Way Home (Harper, 1997), and &#34;Fall from Grace (Harper, 1997).</p><p>From a very young age, MEGAN CHANCE wanted to be a writer, but she made a brief detour at Western Washington University, where she received a B.A. in Broadcast Communications. After several years as a television news photographer, where she found that truth really was stranger than fiction, Megan left broadcasting to write stories of her own. Historical novels were an obvious choice. &#34;The adaptability of the human spirit has always fascinated me, and historical novels allow me to explore that in a way that is both satisfying and life-affirming,&#34; says Megan. &#34;I love immersing myself in another time. Luckily, I also love research-the more arcane, the better.&#34; Born in Columbus, Ohio, Megan moved to Washington State as a girl. She currently lives near Seattle with her family.In this gripping historical, Chance (<i>Susannah Morrow</i>) exposes the horrors women faced in late 19th-century New York when they dared to show passion of any kind or repudiate society's norms. Highborn Lucy Carelton suffers from a common female disorder, "hysteria": its symptoms are headaches, excitable reactions and feelings of claustrophobia. Her cold-hearted, nouveau riche husband, William, determined to find her a cure, brings her to several specialists, who recommend everything from an ovariotomy to several months of confinement in a private asylum. At their wits' ends, the Careltons come to the renowned Dr. Victor Seth, a controversial specialist in the new field of neurology, who uses a combination of hypnosis and electrotherapy to cure his patients. Chance ratchets up the tension when Victor and Lucy's patient/doctor relationship crosses the line into something more intimate and intriguing, as Lucy's horrifying childhood and loveless marriage are brought to light in her therapy. The author showcases the class prejudices inherent in New York's high society in the 1880s and aptly depicts the stifling life a woman had to accept. It becomes clear that the healthier and more independent Lucy is, the more threatened and alienated her husband becomes, and the resulting fallout is catastrophic. The role of the unconscious mind and its impact on conscious behavior is explored in depth here, and Chance ends this lightning-paced narrative with a clever twist underscoring the risks one woman takes to be her own person. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

It took a very long time - over thirteen centuries - for the Roman Empire to grow and then fragment. The Romans did not have it their own way all the time. They were defeated on their own ground several times by Hannibal and - albeit temporarily - by Cleopatra in Egypt, Boudica in Britain, and Zenobia in Syria. Patricia Southern&#39;s masterly book narrates the history of Rome from a settlement of primitive huts to a sophisticated city ruling and then losing an Empire, the lives of such towering figures as Julius Caesar, Augustus, Caligula and Nero, the successes and setbacks and what the Romans learned on their way to Imperial rule and final disintegration.</p><p>Patricia Southern is an acknowledged expert the history of ancient Rome. Her interest began very early, fostered by books and the wonderful epic films that they don&#39;t make any more. This obsession with the Romans has never waned, so whilst working full time as a librarian she studied for a BA degree in Ancient History with the external department of the University of London, and for an MPhil in Roman Frontier Studies at the University of Newcastle upon Tyne, where she was Librarian of the Archaeology Department for many years.

In his lively text, accompanied by 700 full-color illustrations, Gary Schwartz addresses the central controversies, providing art historians, students, and art lovers with essential new insights to help clarify the mysteries surrounding the great painter.</p><p>Gary Schwartz studied art history at NYU and Johns Hopkins. In 1965 he moved to the Netherlands, where he has been active as an art historian, translator, writer, and publisher. A regular contributor to magazines and newspapers in the Netherlands, Germany, and the United States, Schwartz writes a bi-weekly column on art history in the Dutch press, which is circulated in English on the Internet under the title &#x201c;Form Follows Dysfunction.&#x201d;Starred Review. Rembrandt is widely considered one of the most important painters in European art history, and this large, lavishly illustrated volume reinforces that image without skirting controversy (including debates over some of his works' authenticity). Dutch art scholar and columnist Schwartz is clearly an expert on the artist, encapsulating his style in sharp bursts of insight: "Human weakness and-especially-human strength inspired him. He found it not only in heroic action but also in resignation and introspection." But the author doesn't shy from paintings considered less successful, such as the so-called "Leiden history painting," "full of portentous details that do not correspond sufficiently to any known iconography." In contextualizing these works, Schwartz is careful to explain Rembrandt's beliefs, worldview and inspiration: "The text of the Bible was however only one of the givens...along with non-biblical literary sources; models in older art...antiquarian research; knowledge of folkways...and his own imagination." It's this complete view that makes the book so insightful, but it's the personal details that will gain readers' trust: "Few artists' biographers had anything nice to say about him as a person." This detailed, down-to-earth character sketching, combined with solid biographic and historical information, that makes this book as intellectually substantial as it is gorgeous. 700 full-color illustrations. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Enthralled by her grandmother&#39;s story of seeing and hearing whales singing in the sea long ago, Lilly hopes to see them herself and to hear their mysterious songs.</p><p>In this haunting, evocative picture book, Lilly's grandmother tells her that, when she was young, she used to leave gifts for the whales--"a perfect shell. Or a beautiful stone. And if they liked you, the whales would take your gift and give you something in return." Lilly's great-uncle Frederick claims that the story is "nothing but a silly old tale," that she shouldn't "be dreaming her life away." But one morning, Lilly, believing her grandmother's claim that "they were the most wondrous creatures you could ever imagine," drops a yellow flower into the water. " 'This is for you,' she called into the air," and later that night she sits waiting, like a mermaid on a rock, finally receiving a gift in return. Filling the night with their song, the whales call Lilly's name. Infused with the cadences of real speech, Sheldon's poetic text manages to overlay a homespun practicality with an ethereal, fairy-tale magic. The unique grandeur and beauty of these creatures, "as peaceful as the moon," are compellingly interwoven throughout the narrative. Newcomer Blythe's paintings are extraordinary. The play of light and shadow in his cozy interiors is delicately balanced against stunningly realistic faces--Lilly's purity and innocence, her elders' splendidly craggy countenances. Rendered in unusual perspectives, these vibrant panoramas of the sea and of the whales leaping from the moonlit water possess a rare luminosity and beauty that should not be missed. Ages 4-8. <br>Copyright 1991 Reed Business Information, Inc.Lilly's grandmother tells her about whales: ``...big as the hills...peaceful as the moon...wondrous...'' When they were more numerous, she used go to the pier to hear them sing--perhaps in response to her gifts: a perfect shell or stone. Curmudgeonly Great-uncle Frederick counters such fantasies: ``Whales were important for their meat, and for their...blubber.'' Still, Lilly dreams of whales, then throws them a single blossom from the pier. After a long day's wait, she is rewarded by seeing whales jump against the moon while ``their singing filled the night.'' In a spare, poetic narrative, Sheldon captures a child's wonder at these magnificent creatures, echoed, in a splendid debut, in Blythe's generously broad oil paintings. His whales- -viewed from near, unusual vantage points--are benignly heroic while, from dawn to moonlight, his sea and sky are beautifully observed; best are his lovely, perceptive portraits of the old woman's wise, lined face and Lilly's tousled curls and expressive eyes.

Professor White has done justice to the complexity of her subject."&#x2015;Anne Firor Scott, Duke University</strong></p> Living with the dual burdens of racism and sexism, slave women in the plantation South assumed roles within the family and community that contrasted sharply with traditional female roles in the larger American society. This new edition of <em>Ar'n't I a Woman?</em> reviews and updates the scholarship on slave women and the slave family, exploring new ways of understanding the intersection of race and gender and comparing the myths that stereotyped female slaves with the realities of their lives. Above all, this groundbreaking study shows us how black women experienced freedom in the Reconstruction South &#x2015; their heroic struggle to gain their rights, hold their families together, resist economic and sexual oppression, and maintain their sense of womanhood against all odds.</p><p>Deborah Gray White is professor of history and co-director of the Rutgers Center for Historical Analysis at Rutgers University. She is also the author of Too Heavy a Load.This book challenges the myth of the Southern mammy and other myths and attempts a richer, more complex pic ture of the lives of black women in slav ery. Drawing on historical evidence, in cluding slave narratives and the diaries and autobiographies of white Southern ers, as well as on recent scholarship on the black family, the author examines slave women's daily life, occupations, family roles, and female networks. She finds strength and resourcefulness, but denies that female slaves played a dom ineering role in their families. Her view will be of interest to scholars, especial ly those studying comparative female social roles. For most readers, howev er, the story of slave women is better told in Jacqueline Jones's comprehen sive work on black women, Labor of Love, Labor of Sorrow (LJ 3/1/85).

Something messy down on the ledge, maybe a faller from one of the overhanging buildings up in Fourth, maybe all the way from Circuit City. The dispatcher turned to the wall map, surveyed the pin lights and found a clean-up van close enough to take the call. It was one of the older crews, men he knew. He lifted the black handset of his telephone and spun the dial, taking a drag on his cigarette while the switchboard clunked and whirred. </p><p></p><p>'Three oh seven.' </p><p>'Got a smear for you, CuI tel. Something out on the ledge, just west of the waterworks. Not much else out there so you should spot it easy enough. Take the service duct on Seventh and Electric and walk the rest of the way. Keys on the blue hook should get you through any municipal locks.' </p><p>'We're loaded here. And we're about a minute from coming off shift. Can't you pull in someone else?' </p><p>'Not at rush hour I can't. We wait for another van, smear's going to start attracting a crowd and smelling bad. Seagulls are already taking an interest. Sorry, CuI tel, but you're going to have to suck it up and earn some overtime.' </p><p>'Fine. But I was serious about being loaded. You'd better get another van to meet us, case we have to move some stiffs around.' 'I'll see what I can do. Call in when you've peeled it off the concrete; </p><p>we'll start the paperwork at this end.' </p><p>'Copy,' Cultel said. </p><p>'And watch your step out there, boys. It's a long way down, and I don't want to have to call Steamville and tell them they need to deal with a couple of smears of their own.' </p><p>In the clean-up van, CuI tel clicked off his handset and hung it back under the dashboard. He turned to his partner, Gerber, who was digging through a paper bag for the last doughnut. 'You get all that?' </p><p>'Enough.' </p><p>'Another fucking ledge job. They know how much I love ledge jobs.' </p><p>'Like the man said, suck it up and earn some overtime.' Gerber bit into the doughnut and wiped the grease off his lip. 'Sounds good to me.' 'That's because you've got a sweet tooth and expensive girlfriends.' 'It's called having a life outside of scraping pancakes off pavement, </p><p>Cultel. You should try it sometime.' </p><p>Cultel, who always did the driving, grunted something derogatory, engaged the flywheel and powered the van back onto the pick-up slot. Traffic was indeed already thickening into rush hour, cars, taxis, buses and trucks moving sluggishly in one direction, almost nose to tail in the other. Being municipal, they could go off-slot when they needed to, but it still required expert knowledge of the streets and traffic flow not to get snarled up. Cultel always reckoned he could make more money driving taxis than a clean-up wagon, but the advantage of ferrying corpses around was that he mostly didn't need to make conversation. Gerber, who generally had his nose into a bag of doughnuts, didn't really count. </p><p>It took them twenty minutes to make it to Seventh and Electric. The service duct was accessed by a sloping ramp between two buildings, the ramp facing out from Spearpoint, an arched grillwork door at the bottom of it. Cultel disengaged the pick-up shoe and flywheeled down the slope, hoping he'd still have enough spin to get back up it when they had the smear loaded. No sign of the other van yet. He snatched the keyset from the blue tag, grabbed the equipment from behind his seat and left the corrugated-sided van, Gerber carrying a camera and a heavy police-style torch. </p><p>When Cultel was new in Hygiene and Works, the cops were always first on the scene at a faller, with the clean-up crew just there to go through the menial business of peel-off and hose-down. But the cops couldn't keep up lately, and so they were perfectly willing for Hygiene and Works to handle the smears, provided everything was documented and signed off properly. Anything that looked like foul play, the cops could always get involved down the line. Mostly, though, the fallers were just accident victims. Cultel had no reason to expect anything different this time. </p><p>They passed through the municipal gate and walked down the concrete-lined service duct, which was dark and dank, with bits of cladding peeling off every few spans. Rainwater run-off seeped through the cracks and formed into a slow-moving stream deep enough to soak through Cultel's shoes. It smelled a little bit of sewer. Beyond, at the far end of the service duct, was a half-circle of indigo sky. Cultel could already feel the cool evening wind picking up. Back from the ledge, with buildings all around, you didn't feel it much. But it was always colder towards the edges. Quieter, too: it didn't take much to absorb the hum of traffic, the rattle of commuter trains, the moaning of cop car sirens as they wound their way up and down the city's lazy spiral. </p><p>Beyond the duct, the concrete flooring gave way to Spearpoint's under�lying fabric. No one had ever bothered giving the black stuff a name because it was as ubiquitous as air. The ledge began level and then took on a gradually steepening slope. Cultel watched his footing. The stuff was treacherous, everyone knew that. Felt firm as rock one second, slippery as ice the next. </p><p>Gerber waved the torch downslope. 'There's our baby.' </p><p>'I see it.' </p><p>They edged closer, walking sideways as the angle of slope increased, taking increasingly cautious footsteps. The faller had come down about thirty spans from the very edge. In the evening gloom CuI tel made out a head, two arms, two legs, all where they ought to have been. And something crumpled beneath the pale form, like a flimsy, translucent gown. You could never be too sure with fallers but it didn't look as though this one had come down very far. Dismemberment was com�monplace: limbs, heads tended to pop off easily, either with the impact or from glancing collisions on the way down, as the faller bumped against the sides of buildings or the rising wall to the next ledge. But this jigsaw came with all the pieces. </p><p>Cultel looked up, over his shoulder, and lifted the rim of his hat to get a better view. No buildings or overhangs near enough for the faller to have come off. And even if they'd stepped off the next highest ledge, with the way the winds were working they'd have ended up at the base, back behind the rising tide of buildings. Should have been a lot more damage, too. </p><p>'Something's screwed up here,' Cultel said. </p><p>'Just starting to feel that way myself.' Gerber raised the camera to his eye singlehandedly and flashed off two exposures. They crept forwards some more, planting each footstep gently, hardly daring to breathe. Gerber directed the torch a bit more steadily. It was then that Cultel knew what they were dealing with. </p><p>Crushed beneath the form: that wasn't any gown. It was wings. </p><p>'It's-' Gerber started saying. </p><p>'Yeah.' </p><p>What they had was an angel. CuI tel looked up again, higher this time. </p><p>Not just to the nearest line of buildings, but all the way up. Up past the pastel flicker of Neon Heights, up past the hologram shimmer of Circuit City. Up past the pink plasma aura of the cybertowns. He could just see them circling around up there, leagues overhead, wheeling and gyring around Spearpoint's tapering needle like flies around an insect zapper. </p><p>And he thought to himself: <i>How the fuck did one ofthem get down here? And why did it have to happen on my watch?</i> </p><p>'Let's bag and tag,' Gerber said. 'Thing's creeping me out already.' </p><p>'You ever dealt with one of these?' </p><p>'First time. You?' </p><p>'Once when I was new on the job. Fell onto the third rail of the Green Line elevated. Fucking thing was toast by the time we pulled it off. Then again three, maybe four years back. That one was a lot more mashed up than this. Not a whole lot you could recognise at first glance.' </p><p>Gerber fired off another shot with the camera. In the after-flash CuI tel had the weird feeling that the corpse had twitched, shifting almost subliminally from one position to another. He crept up beside the fallen creature and knelt down with his equipment next to him. Overhead the seagulls really were taking an interest, mewling and squabbling in the evening air. CuI tel examined the creature, taking in its nearly naked form, the wings the only visibly broken part of it. It had come to rest with its head lolling to one side, looking at him with huge midnight�blue eyes. It could have been alive, except there was nothing happening behind those eyes. </p><p>'Damn thing must have been alive almost all the way down,' he said. 'This was a controlled landing, not a crash.' 'What a way to go,' Gerber said. 'You think it was suicide, or did it just, you know, lose its way?' </p><p>'Maybe there was a fault with its pack,' CuI tel said, fingering the hard, alien alloy of the angel's propulsion harness. 'Hell, who knows? Cover all the angles, then we'll get it zipped up and into the van. Sooner this is off our hands the better.' </p><p>They got the angel bagged and tagged, taking care not to worsen the damage to the wings or break any of the creature's stick-thin limbs. Lifting the bag, Cultel could easily manage it on his own. It was like carrying a sack of bones and not much else. They didn't even need to hose down the ground. The angel hadn't shed a drop of whatever passed for blood in its veins. </p><p>The other van hadn't arrived when they called back to the dispatcher. 'Sorry, Cultel. Had to send them over to the boundary with Steam �had a report that the zone was shifting around again.' </p><p>'Well, you might want to rethink that. We got the smear.' He glanced at Gerber, grinning in the moment. 'You ready for this? It's an angeL' 'No reports of anything falling down from the Levels, three oh seven.' </p><p>'This one didn't fall. It must have flown almost all the way. Then died.' </p><p>'As they do.' He could hear the practised scepticism in the dispatcher's voice. Didn't much blame him, either. It wouldn't be the first time an angel corpse had been faked up for someone's twisted amusement. Might even be the kind of sick joke someone in Hygiene and Works would play on another clean-up crew, to see how gullible they were. </p><p>But Cui tel knew this was a real one. </p><p>'You want us to squeeze the angel in, we will. Might get a little crumpled in there, but we'll manage. Just so you understand, I'm not taking responsibility for any breakages. I take it you'd like us to ship this thing over to Third?' </p><p>'If you think it's the real deal.' </p><p>'I'll take the fall if it isn't.' </p><p>'Fine; stop by at Third. But remove anything technical. Bag them separately, and we'll box them over to Imports.' Cui tel hung up. 'Why Third? We never deal with Third,' Gerber said. They secured the angel, closed up the van and flywheeled back up the </p><p>access ramp. It was another twenty-minute drive to the Third District Morgue, dodging through short cuts and back alleys, winding their way a little further up the spiralling ledge. The building was an ash-grey slab with a flat roof and a frontage of small square windows, lower than any of the office and apartment blocks crowding in around it. They drove to the rear and backed the van up to the dock, where a white-coated receiving clerk was waiting for them. </p><p>'Dispatch phoned through,' the clerk said as Cultel unlocked the van's rear doors. 'Said you had something juicy for Quillon.' He scratched a pen against his nose. 'Been a while, you know. I think he was starting to wonder if you'd forgotten about the arrangement.' </p><p>'Like we'd forget,' Cultel said, countersigning the delivery form. </p><p>'What's this all about?' Gerber asked. </p><p>'Quillon likes to get first dibs on anything freaky,' the clerk explained. 'Kind of a hobby of his, I guess.' Gerber shrugged. 'Each to their own.' 'Suits everyone,' the clerk said. 'Quillon gets his kicks. The other </p><p>morgues don't have to wade through a ton of paperwork -and there's always a lot of triplicate when one of these things comes in.' He peered at the bagged form as Cultel and Gerber eased it onto a wheeled stretcher. 'Mind if I take a look?' </p><p>'Hey, be my guest,' Cultel said. </p><p>The clerk zipped the bag down half a span. Wrinkled his nose at the dead, pale, broken thing inside. </p><p>'They look so beautiful flying around up there, wings all lit up and glowing.' </p><p>'Cut him some slack.' Cultel zipped the bag tight. 'He's not been having the best of days.' </p><p>'You sure it's a he?' </p><p>'Now that you mention it-' </p><p>'Wheel it through to Quillon if you want,' the clerk said. 'Take the freight elevator to the third. He'll be up there someplace. Gatta wait down here to see in another delivery.' </p><p>'Busy night?' </p><p>'Busy week. They say the boundary's getting itchy feet again.' </p><p>'What I heard,' Cultel said. 'Guess we'd better batten down the hatches and get our watches wound.' </p><p>They pushed the wheeled stretcher into the building. It was all green walls, stark white tiles and the chlorine reek of industrial cleaning solution. The lights in the ceiling were turned down almost to brown. Most of the staff had gone home for the day, leaving the morgue to the night shift and the ghosts of former clients. Cui tel hated the place, as he hated all morgues.

A white surgical coat draped off his thin-ridged shoulders as if it was still on the hanger and a white cap covered his hairless skull. He wore glasses, tinted slightly even though the lights in the morgue were hardly on the bright side. Green surgical gloves that still made his fingers look too long and skeletal for comfort. There were deep shadows under his cheekbones and his skin looked colourless and waxy and not quite alive. </p><p>No getting away from it, Cui tel thought.

One reason, according to Bob Toski, is that they become so engrossed in the mechanics of the swing -- straight left arm, three-knuckle grip, knees flexed, etc. -- that they never develop a sensitivity for the movement of the clubhead. They never learn to swing with the freedom of motion that allows the touring pros to drive 250-300 yards with seemingly little effort. There are some &#34;mechanics&#34; that do need mastering, and they are explained In this book. But the main thrust of the text deals simply with learning to develop and use your senses of sight and feel. Toski, perhaps the game&#39;s finest teacher, tells you, and the illustrations show you, how your swing should feel. He tells you how to cultivate this feel, through the building of &#34;success patterns&#34; in an orderly program of development. Once you learn to play by feel, you will merely visualize the type of shot you wish to play, summon forth the proper feel for that shot, then simply swing the club. Your subconscious will automatically provide you with the swing you need to execute the shot you have planned. The pros play by feel, and so can you. Let Bob Toski, who has taught his Touch System to thousands, free your mind and your body from the complexity of thoughts that stifle long driving and accurate shotmaking.</p><p></p><h2>The Cinematic Legacy of Frank Sinatra</h2><p><p>In a film career spanning more than five decades, Frank Sinatra proved to be a roulette wheel of constantly spinning talent, the likes of which Hollywood has rarely seen. Film history is filled with stars created by the studio system. Occasionally, however, a performer emerged who, against all preconceived odds of what a star should be or look like, knocked down the walls of convention by becoming nothing other than what they already were. Frank Sinatra was the embodiment of this fundamental truth. The legacy of his work stands apart from many of his contemporaries, who essentially based their performances on an extension of a core character type. Sinatra, however, was able to take his signature persona and translate it successfully into many film genres-first as the comedic song-and-dance man, then as the dramatic actor and romantic lead, and finally as the tough guy and action hero. Sinatra also respectfully challenged contemporary ideals of acting technique. While being humble enough to learn from his peers, he kept his acting style fresh and instinctual, and earned an Oscar at a time when many actors were either classically trained or coached in the "Method." </p><p>In <i>The Cinematic Legacy of Frank Sinatra</i>, author David Wills presents a stunning collection highlighting the work of one of Hollywood's greatest stars in roles as varied as those in the classics <i>Anchors Aweigh</i>, <i>From Here to Eternity</i>, <i>Suddenly</i>, <i>Guys and Dolls</i>, <i>The Man With the Golden Arm</i>, <i>Ocean's 11</i>, <i>The Manchurian Candidate</i>, <i>Von Ryan's Express</i>, and <i>The Detective</i>. Pairing more than two hundred first-generation photos with reflections on Sinatra from costars and work associates, and including contributing essays by his children Nancy Sinatra, Tina Sinatra, and Frank Sinatra, Jr., it is an unforgettable showcase of the actor's transformation from world-famous singer, to movie star, to Academy Award winner, and finally to one of the most enduring icons in cinema history.</p></p><p>David Wills has edited numerous photo collections including MARILYN MONROE: METAMORPHOSIS, and AUDREY: THE 60s. He has contributed visual material from his extensive archives to many museums, such as the Museum of Modern Art, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, and the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, and has written for publications including <i>The Huffington Post</i>, <i>V Magazine</i>, and <i>Palm Springs Life</i>.

It's a small, tough place; "There's not a lot else to do in a town like Elliot except drink and punch one another out," observes Reid to his new wife, Freda, their first night there. He and his highly trained German shepherd, Sam, discover otherwise in the weeks that come as they spar with the sadistic sergeant of the police department and ponder the possibility of dishonesty right on up the line, uncovering drug dealing, prostitution payoffs, murder, arson and, in a tense, well-wrought finale, grand larceny. Wood ( When the Killing Starts ) has a nice ear for dialogue, and his outsize (for a mystery), satisfying plot really moves. <br>Copyright 1990 Reed Business Information, Inc.Series policeman Reid Bennett takes a job as constable in Elliot, a mining town in Ontario, in order to investigate allegations of police corruption there. Soon framed for theft and attempt murder, Bennett nevertheless bounces back to become sergeant when his accuser supposedly commits suicide. Efficient, steady, and intelligent as a law officer, Bennett still waxes maudlin around new wife Freda, what with all that hand holding and between-the-lines sex. Despite an overall lack of tension, the story line occasionally bursts forth into activity as Bennett closes in on the true villain (all other prime suspects having expired in violence).

She takes us from the Paleolithic period and the myths of the hunters right up to the �Great Western Transformation� of the last five hundred years and the discrediting of myth by science. The history of myth is the history of humanity, our stories and beliefs, our curiosity and attempts to understand the world, which link us to our ancestors and each other. Myths help us make sense of the universe. Heralding a major series of retellings of international myths by authors from around the world, Armstrong�s characteristically insightful and eloquent book serves as a brilliant and thought-provoking introduction to myth in the broadest sense -- and explains why if we dismiss it, we do so at our peril.</p><p>KAREN ARMSTRONG&#39;S first book, the best-selling Through the Narrow Gate (1981), described her seven years as a nun in a Roman Catholic order. She has published numerous books, including A History of God, which has been translated into thirty languages, A History of Jerusalem and In the Beginning: A New Reading of Genesis. Her more recent works include Islam: A Short History and Buddha, which was an international bestseller. Since 1982 she has been a freelance writer and broadcaster. She lives in London.What is a Myth?<br>Human beings have always been mythmakers. Archaeologists have unearthed Neanderthal graves containing weapons, tools and the bones of a sacrificed animal, all of which suggest some kind of belief in a future world that was similar to their own. The Neanderthals may have told each other stories about the life that their dead companion now enjoyed. They were certainly reflecting about death in a way that their fellow-creatures did not. Animals watch each other die but, as far as we know, they give the matter no further consideration. But the Neanderthal graves show that when these early people became conscious of their mortality, they created some sort of counter-narrative that enabled them to come to terms with it. The Neanderthals who buried their companions with such care seem to have imagined that the visible, material world was not the only reality. From a very early date, therefore, it appears that human beings were distinguished by their ability to have ideas that went beyond their everyday experience.<br><br>We are meaning-seeking creatures. Dogs, as far as we know, do not agonise about the canine condition, worry about the plight of dogs in other parts of the world, or try to see their lives from a different perspective. But human beings fall easily into despair, and from the very beginning we invented stories that enabled us to place our lives in a larger setting, that revealed an underlying pattern, and gave us a sense that, against all the depressing and chaotic evidence to the contrary, life had meaning and value.<br><br>Another peculiar characteristic of the human mind is its ability to have ideas and experiences that we cannot explain rationally. We have imagination, a faculty that enables us to think of something that is not immediately present, and that, when we first conceive it, has no objective existence. The imagin�ation is the faculty that produces religion and mythology. Today mythical thinking has fallen into disrepute; we often dismiss it as irrational and self-indulgent. But the imagination is also the faculty that has enabled scientists to bring new knowledge to light and to invent technology that has made us immeasurably more effective. The imagination of scientists has enabled us to travel through outer space and walk on the moon, feats that were once only possible in the realm of myth. Mythology and science both extend the scope of human beings. Like science and technology, mythology, as we shall see, is not about opting out of this world, but about enabling us to live more intensely within it.<br><br>The Neanderthal graves tell us five important things about myth. First, it is nearly always rooted in the experience of death and the fear of extinction. Second, the animal bones indicate that the burial was accompanied by a sacrifice. Mythology is usually inseparable from ritual. Many myths make no sense outside a liturgical drama that brings them to life, and are incomprehensible in a profane setting. Third, the Neanderthal myth was in some way recalled beside a grave, at the limit of human life. The most powerful myths are about extremity; they force us to go beyond our experience. There are moments when we all, in one way or another, have to go to a place that we have never seen, and do what we have never done before. Myth is about the unknown; it is about that for which initially we have no words. Myth therefore looks into the heart of a great silence. Fourth, myth is not a story told for its own sake. It shows us how we should behave. In the Neanderthal graves, the corpse has sometimes been placed in a foetal position, as though for rebirth: the deceased had to take the next step himself. Correctly understood, mythology puts us in the correct spiritual or psychological posture for right action, in this world or the next.<br><br>Finally, all mythology speaks of another plane that exists alongside our own world, and that in some sense supports it. Belief in this invisible but more powerful reality, sometimes called the world of the gods, is a basic theme of mythology. It has been called the &#x2018;perennial philosophy&#x2019; because it informed the mythology, ritual and social organisation of all societies before the advent of our scientific modernity, and continues to influence more traditional societies today. According to the perennial philosophy, everything that happens in this world, everything that we can hear and see here below has its counterpart in the divine realm, which is richer, stronger and more enduring than our own.1 And every earthly reality is only a pale shadow of its archetype, the original pattern, of which it is simply an imperfect copy. It is only by participating in this divine life that mortal, fragile human beings fulfil their potential. The myths gave explicit shape and form to a reality that people sensed intuitively. They told them how the gods behaved, not out of idle curiosity or because these tales were entertaining, but to enable men and women to imitate these powerful beings and experience divinity themselves.<br><br>In our scientific culture, we often have rather simplistic notions of the divine. In the ancient world, the &#x2018;gods&#x2019; were rarely regarded as supernatural beings with discrete personalities, living a totally separate metaphysical existence. Mythology was not about theology, in the modern sense, but about human experience. People thought that gods, humans, animals and nature were inextricably bound up together, subject to the same laws, and composed of the same divine substance. There was initially no ontological gulf between the world of the gods and the world of men and women. When people spoke of the divine, they were usually talking about an aspect of the mundane. The very existence of the gods was inseparable from that of a storm, a sea, a river, or from those powerful human emotions &#x2014; love, rage or sexual passion &#x2014; that seemed momentarily to lift men and women onto a different plane of existence so that they saw the world with new eyes. <br><br>Mythology was therefore designed to help us to cope with the problematic human predicament. It helped people to find their place in the world and their true orientation. We all want to know where we came from, but because our earliest beginnings are lost in the mists of prehistory, we have created myths about our forefathers that are not historical but help to explain current attitudes about our environment, neighbours and customs. We also want to know where we are going, so we have devised stories that speak of a posthumous existence &#x2014; though, as we shall see, not many myths envisage immortality for human beings. And we want to explain those sublime moments, when we seem to be transported beyond our ordinary concerns. The gods helped to explain the experience of transcendence. The perennial philosophy expresses our innate sense that there is more to human beings and to the material world than meets the eye.</p><h2>The Gun digest book of exploded firearms drawings 2nd edition by Murtz, Harold A (1977) Paperback</h2><p>305 isometric views of modern and collector&#39;s handguns and long guns.</p><p></p><h2>Cake and Punishment: A Southern Cake Baker Mystery</h2><p><b>In the first of a delectable new Southern-set baking cozy series, Sophia Cummings, pastry chef extraordinaire, must craft the perfect cake for an old friend&#x2019;s wedding while sifting through the suspects in a murder. </b><br><br>Bucolic Rumford, Kentucky has glowing fields of bluegrass, a fine selection of bourbons, and now a professional pastry chef.

He&#x2019;d also had a gold ring in his left eyebrow, and he&#x2019;d worn thick glasses.</p><p>Now he was at least two inches taller&#x2014;I guessed his new height at six feet&#x2014;and thirty pounds more muscular. He&#x2019;d definitely lost the scrawny teenage look, and he&#x2019;d also lost the piercings and the glasses. I could barely see the scars where the earlobes had been repaired. He blinked, and I diagnosed contact lenses. Instead of ragged jeans, he was wearing a brand-name polo, khakis, and boat shoes. The result was a great-looking guy.</p><p>I counted mentally. Yes, Jeff would have been a senior at Southern Methodist University this year. &#x201c;Did you just graduate?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yep, I squeaked through. BA in history. And I even got into graduate school at UT.&#x201d;</p><p>University of Texas; all of us Texans know those initials. &#x201c;Wonderful! What&#x2019;s your field?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Maybe Texas history. I think I want to teach. I got a slot as a graduate assistant. And I had an offer of an internship at the Texas Museum of Popular Culture. I had to turn that down because I had a conflict.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s still great.&#x201d; I leaned toward Jeff and dropped my voice. &#x201c;What does your dad think of a history career?&#x201d;</p><p>He laughed. &#x201c;He&#x2019;d rather I got an MBA, of course, but he said he&#x2019;d pay my grad school tuition and books.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s proud of you, Jeff.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Maybe. Most of the time he hides it. He&#x2019;d still like me to sell real estate.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Do your own thing.&#x201d; I shook a finger at him. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m really tickled to see you. Joe and I live in the old cottage now. I hope you&#x2019;ll stay with us.&#x201d;</p><p>Jeff straightened his shoulders a little. &#x201c;Thanks, but I already have a hotel room. I&#x2019;m actually doing a research project this trip. Warner Pier was all booked up, but I&#x2019;ve got a room in Holland. And I hope you and Joe&#x2014;and Aunt Nettie and her husband, too&#x2014;will let me take you all out to dinner tonight.&#x201d;</p><p>I knew Aunt Nettie would want to cook for Jeff&#x2014;she wants to feed the whole world&#x2014;but I could see Jeff was spreading his grown-up wings a little. I assured him we&#x2019;d all love to be his guests.</p><p>&#x201c;And I can legitimately write it off as part of my research,&#x201d; Jeff said.</p><p>&#x201c;What are you residing? I mean, researching?&#x201d; Yikes! I&#x2019;d pulled another one of my tongue twisters.</p><p>Jeff didn&#x2019;t react to it. &#x201c;Did you ever hear of anybody around here named Fal-cone? Or Fal-cone-ie? I&#x2019;m not sure of the pronunciation.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Sounds too Italian for Warner Pier. You know nearly everybody around here is Dutch.&#x201d;</p><p>I picked up the phone book and thumbed through, hunting for the <i>F</i> listings, but Jeff stood up. &#x201c;I already checked the directories and the Internet. No person or business with that name is listed.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;We can ask Aunt Nettie. She knows more people than I do. She&#x2019;s in Holland for a dental appointment. She&#x2019;ll want to see you as soon as she gets back.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;She was so nice to me. Before. Is the Inn on the Pier still a good place to eat?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Sure.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Seven o&#x2019;clock?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;That sounds fine.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;See you there.&#x201d;</p><p>We exchanged cell phone numbers, and I added a warning. &#x201c;Big areas around here still have no cell service. Including our house. The only place Joe and I have reception&#x2014;most of the time&#x2014;is on the roof! They blame the lake, but I have my doubts. They put a tower on one of the highest spots in Saugatuck and reception around there improved dramatically.&#x201d; I stood up. &#x201c;Wait a minute, and I&#x2019;ll walk you to the door.&#x201d;</p><p>I reached for my crutch. For the first time Jeff saw that and my orthopedic boot.</p><p>&#x201c;Hey, Lee! What have you done to yourself?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Nothing serious. I sprained an ankle on those steep stairs at the house. I&#x2019;m sure you remember them.&#x201d;</p><p>Jeff nodded. He&#x2019;d slept in an upstairs bedroom on his previous visit to Warner Pier, and once or twice he had nearly fallen down our steep stairs himself.</p><p>&#x201c;They tell me no permanent damage has been done,&#x201d; I said, &#x201c;but the doctor wants me to keep weight off the ankle for a while.&#x201d;</p><p>I stumped along behind Jeff as we passed through our retail shop, and I insisted he select a chocolate. He went for a dark chocolate falcon, a two-inch replica of the famous film bird that we had created especially for the film festival.</p><p>When we reached the street door, we did our belly-bump-air-kiss-hug act again.</p><p>&#x201c;Seven o&#x2019;clock,&#x201d; Jeff said.</p><p>&#x201c;Seven o&#x2019;clock,&#x201d; I answered.</p><p>And at seven o&#x2019;clock four of us&#x2014;my husband, Joe; my aunt Nettie; her husband, Police Chief Hogan Jones; and me&#x2014;met in the bar at the Inn on the Pier, ready to have dinner with Jeff. I had told everyone how good he had looked, how mature he had seemed, and how pleased he had been at the prospect of seeing all of us again.</p><p>So it was quite a letdown when he didn&#x2019;t show up.</p><p>�&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�</p><p>We waited in the bar until eight o&#x2019;clock. I knew, because I checked my watch&#x2014;again&#x2014;the third time the hostess came to tell us we could have a table.</p><p>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t understand this,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;I can call Jeff&#x2019;s cell phone again.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Let&#x2019;s take this table in any case,&#x201d; Hogan said. &#x201c;Dinner will be my treat.&#x201d;</p><p>Aunt Nettie looked worried. She had beautiful curly white hair and a sweet face. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m afraid something has happened to Jeff.&#x201d;</p><p>Joe laughed. &#x201c;Something has! He&#x2019;s run into someone more interesting. Despite the changes in his appearance, Lee, I&#x2019;m afraid Jeff is still the irresponsible kid who showed up on your roof nearly four years ago and tried to break in through the upstairs window.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Hand me my crutch,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;Once we&#x2019;re seated, I&#x2019;ll try his cell phone again.&#x201d;</p><p>But there was still no answer.</p><p>Hogan left his menu closed and began to make noises like a cop. &#x201c;Do you know where Jeff was staying?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;A Holland motel.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;That narrows it down to maybe fifty, sixty places. Does he have your cell phone number?&#x201d;</p><p>I nodded.</p><p>&#x201c;Did he say why he came to Warner Pier?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;He said he was going to catch part of the film festival, and that he was doing a research project. But he didn&#x2019;t explain anything about it. He asked me if I knew anyone named Fal-cone or Fal-cone-ie. He wasn&#x2019;t sure of the pronunciation.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Falconi?&#x201d; Aunt Nettie looked surprised. &#x201c;That would be an odd name around Warner Pier. Valk, maybe.&#x201d;</p><p>Valk? What could Valk have to do with Falcone? I started to ask Aunt Nettie to explain, but the waiter interrupted. We all put our attention on the menus, and after we had ordered dinner some unwritten rule of good manners inspired us to stop discussing Jeff.</p><p>But why had Jeff invited us all to dinner, then failed to show up? I had no explanation. But then, maybe I didn&#x2019;t know Jeff all that well.</p><p>His parents, Dina and Rich, had divorced when Jeff was nine. Three years later I married Rich, who was then in his early forties. I was twenty-three. Dumb. Dumb. Dumb. Marrying Rich was the stupidest thing I ever did, though the age difference was the least of our problems.</p><p>Today I understood that I fell for Rich because I wanted stability in my life. He fell for me because I was six feet tall and a natural blond who had been in a Miss Texas competition.</p><p>Also, I think, he liked me because I have malapropism. This means I get my tongue twisted, saying such things as &#x201c;residing&#x201d; when I mean &#x201c;researching,&#x201d; as I did when talking to Jeff. Rich thought &#x201c;dumb&#x201d; and &#x201c;blond&#x201d; were synonyms, and he didn&#x2019;t want any mental competition from his wife. He loved it when I goofed.</p><p>In those days Jeff was a bratty adolescent. Rich had his custody one or two weekends a month and on some holidays. Or maybe I had his custody. Rich was a successful real estate developer in Dallas, and he often managed to be playing golf with a client at the times when he should have been paying attention to Jeff. I will say he was careful not to miss any of Jeff&#x2019;s swim meets. The kid could swim and dive like a dolphin.</p><p>There&#x2019;s a fine line between getting along with an adolescent and keeping one from bossing you around. Jeff was a nice enough kid, but dealing with a stepmother who was only eleven years older than he was&#x2014;well, it wasn&#x2019;t an ideal situation for either of us.</p><p>After some sparring around, Jeff and I developed an informal truce. We spent a lot of time on neutral activities such as playing board games and watching old movies. Even in those days Jeff was a fan of forties and fifties noir films and books.</p><p>For five years I struggled to make my marriage work. But my relationship with Rich got worse and worse. I wanted to think of marriage as a partnership. Rich wanted to think of me as a possession. I&#x2019;d become the proverbial trophy wife, and I didn&#x2019;t like it. And I couldn&#x2019;t get Rich even to discuss the situation.</p><p>Finally I left, and I didn&#x2019;t take anything with me. I abandoned my jewelry (selected by Rich), my snazzy car (picked out by Rich), my elegant house (gussied up by a decorator Rich chose), even my wardrobe (though Rich had allowed me to pick out my own clothes, provided I went to the stores he approved of).</p><p>When I left Rich I drove away in a junky car somebody had abandoned at my dad&#x2019;s garage. I was wearing an old pair of jeans and a T-shirt. I moved in with my mom, who was on Rich&#x2019;s side, and I begged until she bought me a tank of gas. Then I took a job as a waitress because I could start work that day and keep my tips.</p><p>My plan was to convince Rich that I loved <i>him</i>, not his money, and thus save my marriage. This did not work. It took a couple of months with a counselor for me to understand that Rich regarded his money as part of his personality. In rejecting it, I had rejected him.</p><p>When I discovered Rich had put detectives on my trail, I accepted the end of my marriage. I wasn&#x2019;t seeing anyone else, but Rich couldn&#x2019;t believe I&#x2019;d leave one wealthy man without having a new one lined up.</p><p>About the time my marriage ended, my wonderful aunt Nettie&#x2014;world&#x2019;s finest chocolatier&#x2014;offered me a job as business manager of TenHuis Chocolade. I moved to Warner Pier. I met Joe Woodyard&#x2014;who had also had some unhappy romantic times. Now we&#x2019;d been married three years. And I loved my life.</p><p>But apparently my decision to get a divorce brought a personality crisis for Rich. He went into counseling and must have done a lot of self-examination. Then he began to see Dina again. A year and a half after our divorce, the two of them remarried.</p><p>I wished them all sorts of happiness. But that part of my life was over. I didn&#x2019;t want to see them ever again. However, I could hardly refuse to meet with Jeff. He and I had watched a lot of Humphrey Bogart and Alan Ladd.</p><p>But why had Jeff invited us all to dinner, then failed to show?</p><p>I went to bed that night puzzled by Jeff&#x2019;s nonappearance, but trying not to worry about him. Unfortunately the scrabbling of my thoughts was echoed by some darn animal making noises in the attic (a chronic problem of semirural living) and I had trouble falling asleep. I insisted to myself that Joe was right; Jeff had simply found someone more interesting to have dinner with. I shouldn&#x2019;t be wringing my hands over him.</p><p>�&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�</p><p>I was still sleeping when the phone rang at seven the next morning. Joe was already awake, and he answered it.</p><p>&#x201c;Oh, hi.&#x201d; He sounded wary. &#x201c;Sure. She&#x2019;s here.&#x201d;</p><p>Where else would I be at that time of day? I took the phone and mumbled my greeting. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s Lee.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Lee, it&#x2019;s Alicia.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Alicia?&#x201d; I sat up in bed. I had recognized the Texas accent immediately. &#x201c;Alicia Richardson!&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Oh yeah. The same old gal. How you doin&#x2019;?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Fine! It&#x2019;s good to hear from you.&#x201d;</p><p>And it was good. Alicia was a part of my life in Dallas I remembered with pleasure. At one time she&#x2019;d helped me out a lot.</p><p>Alicia was office manager and head of accounting for Rich&#x2019;s company. I guess every business has one key person, and at Godfrey Development, Alicia was it. She had worked for Rich for at least fifteen years. She knew where all the bodies were buried, where all the money was socked away, who couldn&#x2019;t stand whom, and how to Get Things Done.</p><p>On a day-to-da...</p></p><h2>American Civil War Artillery 1861-65: Field and Heavy Artillery (Special Editions (Military))</h2><p>This book combines New Vanguard 38: &#x2018;American Civil War Artillery 1861-65 (1) Field Artillery&#x2019; and New Vanguard 40: &#x2018;American Civil War Artillery 1861-65 (2) Heavy Artillery&#x2019;. Perhaps the most influential arm of either army in the prosecution of the American Civil War, the artillery of both sides grew to be highly professional organizations. Because of the length of the coastline of the United States, from the beginning American ordnance placed an emphasis on its &#x2018;Heavy Artillery&#x2019; mounted in coastal defenses, while their &#x2018;Field Artillery&#x2019; units were assigned across the fighting fronts. In battle, the introduction of both the 12-pdr. Napoleon and rifled cannon provided a range and power previously unknown on American soil.

In addition to a 500-page biography, this Hendrix cornucopia offers all the bells and whistles of a 100-page discography, with over 200 photographs, mementos and pieces of correspondence, a detailed chronology, and a unique appendix delineating Hendrix's guitars, equipment, and playing techniques, all of which contain sumptuous notes. Of the Hendrix mystique and deification since his death at age 27 in 1970, the authors write, "it would be a fitting tribute to Jimi's memory if his substance could begin to predominate over his image." Shapiro and Glebbeek have made a contribution of inestimable value toward this goal. One of the year's best popular music biographies and a mandatory purchase for all libraries. Previewed in Prepub Alert, LJ 3/1/91.<br><i>- Barry Miller, Austin P.L., Tex.</i><br>Copyright 1991 Reed Business Information, Inc.Sympathetic and comprehensive, this biography of left-handed guitar wizard Jimi Hendrix (1942-1970) features an exhaustive Hendrix discography, a list of his equipment and a file of film and photo appearances. Shapiro ( Waiting for the Man: Drugs and Popular Music ) and Glebbeek, founder of the Hendrix Information Centre in Ireland, regale the reader with quotes, anecdotes, song analyses and mini-bios of Hendrix colleagues, including the Jimi Hendrix Experience's drummer Mitch Mitchell and bassist Noel Redding. The musician is portrayed as a perfectionist, brilliant composer whose imaginative sound effects were limited only by equipment; a black artist under pressure from radical black groups because his audience was predominantly white; a dedicated guitarist overwhelmed by his lifestyle. Hendrix's drug abuse and death from a probable barbiturate overdose are not sensationalized as the authors concentrate on his formidable music legacy, flamboyant individualism and sense of humor.

Alone Together presents a history of the "invention" of New York apartment houses.</p></p><p><p>Elizabeth Collins Cromley is Professor of Architectural History at Northeastern University and the coauthor of Invitation to Vernacular Architecture.</p><p>"Cromley explores in words, vintage photographs and architects' drawings the evolution of the Big Apple's apartment blocks.... More than just architectural history, this is a glimpse at the evolution of American urban culture."</p><br><br><p>"After the Civil War, New York City developed an architectural form new to North America&#x2015;a building designed as a multiple dwelling for middle-class families. The author chronicles the technological and the social evolution of the apartment house.... Along the way, she describes the domestic manners of New Yorkers of every class, from tenement-dwellers to the inhabitants of luxury apartments, and their rising expectations (indoor plumbing, for example) over a period of fifty years."</p><br><br><p>"Cromley has done a superb job of describing the initial resistance to collective living, how architects attempted to solve the problem of domestic privacy, and how apartment living revolutionized traditional housekeeping activities. Particularly fascinating are her insights into how families adapted to the new form of housing and how the apartment building of today evolved."</p></p><h2>Horse Lovers Scroll Saw Projects</h2><p>Trotters, thoroughbreds, farm teams, and draft horses are all celebrated in this collection of 50 projects -- clocks, plaques, desk accessories, gifts -- that will delight the horse-loving woodworker.</p><p><b>John A.

Have you ever had a good idea? Of course you have! But have you ever made money from one of your good ideas?</p><p>The most successful businesses are created by solving a problem or serving a need. The initial thought triggers your entrepreneurial spirit, and instantly creates intellectual property that belongs to you. As defined by the World Intellectual Property Organization, &#x201c;<i>Intellectual property</i> refers to creations of the mind, such as inventions; literary and artistic works; designs; and symbols, names and images used in commerce.&#x201d; It is the intangible asset that results from human intellect, creativity, innovation, and know-how and from reputation and goodwill created by relationships with others.</p><p>Only a few decades ago, the value of the bulk of US corporate assets was from tangible assets, such as property, plant, and equipment. Intangibles, such as intellectual property, represented only approximately 20 percent of the value of corporate assets. However, by 2005, that ratio of intangible to tangible corporate assets had essentially reversed; the market value of the S&amp;P 500 was approximately 80 percent intangible assets. According to the US Department of Commerce, &#x201c;[t]he entire U.S. economy relies on some form of intellectual property, because virtually every industry either produces or uses it.&#x201d;</p><p>In other words, the future of our economy depends on intellectual property triggered by entrepreneurial thoughts! No longer do you need vast amounts of capital to start and build a business. With this shift in the importance of intellectual property, combined with the ease of communication provided by the Internet, it has never been easier to build a business around your good ideas.</p><p>My business success has come from creating intellectual property related to educational products like books and games and then building the businesses to deliver them. I had the pleasure of working closely with my wonderful husband, Michael Lechter, who is recognized internationally for his intellectual property expertise.</p><p>Once you think of a way to solve a problem or serve a need, you may also want to put certain legal protection mechanisms in place (things like patents, trademark and copyright registrations, and contractual agreements) and you will want to create the system that will allow you to deliver the solution or provide the service. That system creates your business&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. a business born from your thoughts.</p><p>This book has been written for you at the perfect time. It shares the stories of some incredible people who not only built successful businesses using this model, but made significant positive impacts on their communities in the process. As you read their stories, keep a journal nearby so you can record the thoughts that spring into your mind!</p><p>Your next thought could ignite your entrepreneurial spirit, creating intellectual property for you&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and the beginnings of your next business. Here&#x2019;s to your million-dollar idea!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x2014;SHARON LECHTER, CPA, CGMA</p><p>Author of <i>Think and Grow Rich for Women</i> and <i>Save Wisely, Spend Happily</i></p><p>Coauthor of <i>Outwitting the Devil</i>, <i>Three Feet from Gold</i>, and <i>Rich Dad Poor Dad</i></p><p></p><p></p><p>INTRODUCTION</p><p>You are the master of your destiny. You can influence, direct, and control your own environment. You can make your life what you want it to be.</p><p>&#x2014;NAPOLEON HILL</p><p>Every year has its high points: achievements and advancements that leave an indelible mark upon history and upon society as a whole.</p><p>The year 1937 was no exception. In fact, I consider it one of the most significant years in all of human experience.</p><p>This was the year that saw the release of Walt Disney&#x2019;s first full-length animated feature film&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. the emergence of a thrilling and controversial new artist named Pablo Picasso&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and the completion of the Golden Gate Bridge. Nylon was patented in 1937, and Howard Hughes made his record-breaking coast-to-coast voyage. It was also the year <i>The Hobbit</i> had its literary debut, as well as <i>Of Mice and Men</i> and <i>Out of Africa</i>.</p><p>Remarkable as they are, however, it&#x2019;s not any of these milestones that makes 1937 such a significant historical moment, in my estimation. It was the publication of another groundbreaking book, a book that would go on to profoundly influence tens of millions of lives, right up through this very day, and undoubtedly beyond it.</p><p>The story behind the creation of this miraculous work is one of the more fascinating tales of the early twentieth century&#x2014;one that perfectly captures the near-mythological dynamism, excitement, and can-do spirit of the era.</p><p>It all started in the mind of the great steel magnate and philanthropist Andrew Carnegie. Carnegie&#x2019;s was the ultimate rags-to-riches tale. Born penniless in Scotland, he emigrated to America with his parents as a boy, and eventually rose to become the wealthiest businessman of his time, founding the company that would eventually form one of the cornerstones of US Steel.</p><p>Carnegie knew what he&#x2019;d done to achieve his enormous wealth and success, and he had a theory. He was convinced that great achievement was a matter of doing a few certain things in a certain way. He believed that these certain things were the common denominator shared by all successful people. And he was convinced that if they could be discerned and delineated in a step-by-step formula, anyone, of any background or circumstance, could become wealthy and successful as well, simply by following it.</p><p>So he enlisted the help of a young reporter to help him prove his theory&#x2014;and perhaps change the world in the process.</p><p>In 1908, this reporter, Napoleon Hill, had been assigned to interview the great industrialist as part of his publication&#x2019;s series on successful men. Originally slated to take three hours, the interview went on for three full days and three full nights before it was complete.</p><p>Even more remarkable than the longevity of the interview was the offer Carnegie made to his visitor when the interview wound to a close:</p><p>Young man, if you are willing to work for me&#x2014;for free&#x2014;for twenty years, I will send you on a mission to meet the most powerful and influential leaders of our time. During these encounters, you will discover and create the first-ever formula for personal success.</p><p>It was a stunning proposition, one not many people would have had the guts or foresight to accept. But Napoleon Hill wasn&#x2019;t just anyone. He was somehow able to comprehend, in just a few seconds, the incredible potential in the opportunity before him&#x2014;for both himself and the world. He looked the great man squarely in the eye and said, &#x201c;Mr. Carnegie, not only will I accept your proposal, I promise I will complete it.&#x201d;</p><p>Hill didn&#x2019;t know it at the time, but he wasn&#x2019;t the first recipient of Carnegie&#x2019;s remarkable proposition. More than 250 men had been presented with the great man&#x2019;s unconventional offer.</p><p>He was, however, the first one to accept it.</p><p>He also didn&#x2019;t realize until later just how crucial his decisiveness on the matter had been. A stickler for action, Carnegie had privately decided he would give his guest just sixty seconds to make up his mind once the proposition had been laid on the table. He knew what the job would entail, and he wasn&#x2019;t interested in wafflers. When Hill walked out of the office, his host pulled from his pocket the stopwatch he had started. There were still thirty-one seconds left.</p><p>Clearly, Carnegie had found his man.</p><p>Carnegie had promised to furnish Hill a letter of recommendation to the titans of the age, assuring him that when these men saw who had sent him, they would give him all the time he needed. True to his word, he gave the young author access to the brains of the era&#x2019;s great thought leaders, including Thomas Edison, Henry Ford, Alexander Graham Bell, and the Rockefellers, among others.</p><p>Hill interviewed them all&#x2014;and hundreds more&#x2014;over a period of many years, shaping along the way the formula Carnegie had envisioned. In 1937, nearly twenty years after setting out on his quest, he published his findings in what would go on to become one of the best-selling and most influential books of all time&#x2014;<i>Think and Grow Rich</i>.</p><p>In this slim volume, Hill presented the distillation of all he had learned in what he termed the Philosophy of Achievement. This philosophy consisted of thirteen individual principles, or &#x201c;keys to success,&#x201d; which included:</p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;Definiteness of Purpose<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;The Power of the Master Mind<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;Going the Extra Mile<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;Applied Faith<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;A Pleasing Personality<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;Self-discipline<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;Positive Mental Attitude<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;Enthusiasm<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;Personal Initiative<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;Learning from Adversity and Defeat<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;Creative Vision<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;Accurate Thinking<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;Cosmic Habit Force<p>Hill theorized that these keys would unlock the door to lifelong success, abundance, and fulfillment for anyone who mastered them. It was a tantalizing promise, of course, but it soon became clear that there was real substance behind it. People who faithfully applied the principles discovered that, lo and behold, they <i>worked</i>&#x2014;in exactly the way Hill said they would. Indeed, this was a formula for success: solid, reliable, and available to anyone and everyone who wanted it.</p><p>Carnegie&#x2019;s theory was proven&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and a legend was born.</p><p>It is almost impossible to overstate the impact that <i>Think and Grow Rich</i> has had since its publication. At the time of Hill&#x2019;s death in 1970, it had already sold twenty million copies. Today, that number is estimated at close to seventy million&#x2014;and those numbers don&#x2019;t take into account the unknown millions who received the book from someone else, or picked it up at a used-book store or the library. It is one of the cornerstones of the modern self-growth movement and has been openly credited as the inspiration behind many of the most successful corporations, organizations, and careers in the world.</p><p>My own first encounter with this life-changing book occurred in 1961, more than half a century after Hill&#x2019;s momentous first meeting with Andrew Carnegie. Seeing the state my young life was in, an older and much wiser friend (whom I soon came to see as a kind of guardian angel) handed me a copy of <i>Think and Grow Rich</i> and rather strongly suggested I read it.</p><p>My life was never the same again.</p><p>Up until that point I was, in a word, lost. I had a job that was going nowhere. I was in an amount of debt I couldn&#x2019;t imagine being able to repay. I had no plans, no ambition of any kind&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. no vision of a future meaningfully different or better than the present situation I was in.</p><p><i>Think and Grow Rich</i> changed all of that. Instantly.</p><p>Through <i>Think and Grow Rich</i>, my eyes were opened to a universe of possibilities of whose existence I previously had absolutely no awareness. And the wondrous &#x201c;aha&#x201d; at the heart of it all was the sudden understanding of the limitless potential that lay within my own mind&#x2014;more specifically, the enormous, extraordinary power of my <i>thoughts</i>.</p><p>Now, this wasn&#x2019;t something I&#x2019;d ever considered before. To the extent that I&#x2019;d given any consideration at all to the &#x201c;why&#x201d; behind my circumstances, I saw myself the way many people in the world do: as a victim. I had no idea that I&#x2019;d thought myself into the mess I was in. It certainly never occurred to me that I could think my way out of it.</p><p>This realization ignited a fierce, profound passion in me. I became ravenous for, sought out, and found as much information and insight on the subject of self-development as I possibly could. I found it in other books, such as James Allen&#x2019;s immortal <i>As a Man Thinketh</i> and Wallace Wattles&#x2019;s masterpiece <i>The Science of Getting Rich</i>. I found it in mentors like the legendary &#x201c;dean of personal development&#x201d; Earl Nightingale and his business partner, Lloyd Conant, whom I eventually worked with at their pioneering company, Nightingale-Conant.</p><p>And over and over again, at every chance I got, I reread the book that started it all for me: Napoleon Hill&#x2019;s <i>Think and Grow Rich</i>.</p><p></p></p><h2>Bringing Heaven Down to Earth - Book II</h2><p>Rabbi Menachem Mendel (1902-1994) is known worlwide as simply the Rebbe-meaning my teacher.

The maverick author of <i>Change Your Brain, Change Your Life</i> and Healing ADD now presents his proven program for repairing and strengthening our relationships, child-rearing practices, work and study routines, and, ultimately, our soulful connections, in the deepest ways possible. Guided by this book, each of us can learn to balance and optimize the parts of the brain responsible for inner growth, intimacy, and spiritual health. <p>Drawing upon his experience with over fourteen thousand brain-imaging studies of patients from all walks of life, Dr. Amen has developed an essential tool called the Amen Brain System Checklist, a 101-question self-test used to evaluate the five brain systems that are key to achieving and maintaining a healthy brain-soul connection. The questionnaire identifies the problem brain areas readers may need to work on, offers insight into the degree to which these imbalances affect their lives, and provides targeted strategies for each area of the brain involved with spiritual issues.</p><p>These are just a few of the many "brain prescriptions" to be found in <i>Healing the Hardware of the Soul:</i></p><p></p><ul><li>Develop focus and improve decision-making with the One-Page Miracle for the Soul </li><li>Use prayer, meditation, and diaphragmatic breathing exercises for superior emotional and spiritual flexibility</li><li>Heal painful deep soul memories through thought and behavior exercises</li><li>Learn how forming strong, positive new bonds actually controls impulsive behavior and stabilizes mood swings </li></ul><p>Dr. Amen's recommendations include cutting-edge advice on diet, nutritional supplements, and the judicious use of medication when needed. He also explains which medications can unbalance the brain when used improperly. Dramatic before-and-after pictures of the brain demonstrate the medical effectiveness of these clinically based healing techniques. </p><p>Whether we learn the self-help strategies of cognitive reprogramming, self-hypnosis, or nutraceutical therapy, seek out psychotherapy, or rely on prescription antidepressants and antianxiety medications, Dr. Amen's sage advice and comprehensive treatment programs give us all the tools we need to optimize our work, relationships, and spiritual connections to become the people we want to be.</p></p><p>As the title suggests, <i>Healing the Hardware of the Soul</i> is a unique blend of advanced scientific technique and fundamental religious principles. Dr. Daniel Amen, a graduate of Oral Roberts University, isn't promoting a strictly Christian agenda, but he makes it repeatedly clear that one of the crucial steps in achieving mental health is prayer. Depending on your beliefs, this insistence can range from pleasing to offensive. <p> His work is centered around the physical aspects of the brain--in some ways, it resembles a modern form of phrenology. Using detailed imaging technology, he has established connections between specific behaviors--panic disorders, depression, ADD--and over- or underactive areas of the brain. As with most new forms of medical research, his work is both lauded and ridiculed, and only further research will determine its ultimate validity.</p><p> For people anxious to put his findings to use, there are several chapters devoted to questionnaires that can be used in place of brain scans. Exercises and suggestions follow, and stay surprisingly simple--forming personal connections, seeking appropriate medical care and medications, and creating short-term, specific goals are a few old standbys. Regardless of what methods Amen is using to arrive at the solutions, it's clear he finds plenty of value in tried-and-true solutions. <i>--Jill Lightner</i></p><b>Daniel G.

Crier, a former judge and one of television's most popular legal analysts, was among the first to question the behaviour of Laci's husband, Scott Peterson. And with her network of journalistic sources, Crier was soon able to penetrate the core of the police investigation that followed &#x2013; gaining access to a huge and revealing body of police reports, wiretap transcripts of unreported conversations of Scott's, photographic evidence, and other exclusive materials. Drawing on these resources &#x2013; and on extensive interviews with key witnesses and both of the lead investigators on the case &#x2013; Crier has written this astonishingly detailed and intimate look at the most unforgettable murder case in America since that of O.J. Simpson.</p><p> Thoroughly engrossing yet highly disturbing, Catherine Crier's <em>A Deadly Game</em> will make news &#x2013; and create an indelible portrait of a sociopathic killer. </p></p><p><p>Catherine Crier is the host of Court TV's <em>Catherine Crier Live</em>. A distinguished attorney, legal analyst, and the youngest state judge ever to be elected in Texas, Crier has received an Emmy Award for investigative journalism and the DuPont-Columbia Journalism Award. Also the author of the <em>New York Times</em> bestsellers <em>A Deadly Game</em> and <em>The Case Against Lawyers</em>, Crier lives in Westchester County, New York.</p>After the seemingly never-ending media coverage of pregnant Laci Peterson's Christmas Eve 2002 disappearance and husband Scott's subsequent arrest, trial, conviction and death-penalty sentence for her murder, it's hard to believe anything about this notorious case could still be "untold." But Court TV anchor Crier and co-author Thompson's encyclopedic tome includes never-before-released transcripts of conversations between Scott and others (which don't significantly impact one's understanding of the case, however) and a 38-page appendix of photos, documents and other police evidence. Although much of the information in this book has been reported previously or revealed at trial, anyone looking for a comprehensive overview of the case will find it here. The authors chart not only the police investigation and trial but the personal and family history of Scott and Laci. A more balanced examination of the case is all that's missing to make this book really stand out. Up front, Crier states that since the first days of the case, she felt certain that Scott was a sociopath responsible for his wife's disappearance, and throughout the book, she demonstrates how and why. Given Scott's behavior in the weeks prior to and immediately after Laci's disappearance, not to mention all the lies he told to police, family and friends, she's not exactly going out on a limb. Although few people would doubt Scott's guilt, the whole book is very pro-police-it's even dedicated "To all those who protect and serve." Had the authors started from a presumption of innocence and turned a critical eye on the investigation, which yielded more circumstantial than solid forensic evidence, the book would have been more compelling, but its thoroughness will draw many readers nonetheless. 12 pages of color photos. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Only they had not really reached pistol-point because Jack had stepped backward in a doorway, and cannoned into him, making him spill his glass of champagne, and treading on his foot. Nor had Jack turned pale and tight-lipped with anger because he had cursed him for being a clumsy oaf. If you had known a fellow from the cradle, had played with him, gone to school with him, shot, fished, and hunted with him, you could curse him with impunity, and either it ended in a bout of fisticuffs or in laughter: not in a meeting in the chill morning, attended by seconds. Even had they not been such close friends that sort of thing was out of date: rubbishing stuff, fit only for the stage! Tom's grandfather, of course, had been out five times, if the family legends were to be believed, on the most trifling provocation. He had once fought Jack's great-uncle George and very comical they must have looked, Jack and he had often thought, giggling over it, with their shaven polls (for they had worn wigs, both of them), and the absurd ruffles they affected in place of wristbands, and had to tuck up, and their bare feet probably much bruised by the unkind ground. Nowadays, if one fought a duel, one chose pistols, and one didn't make a cake of oneself over the business. But very few people did fight duels, and certainly not because they had been jostled in doorways.</p> <p>Only it wasn't that. This unthinkable situation had arisen out of something far more serious. Not that one could call Marianne Treen serious: she was the gayest and most light-hearted of all possible causes of dissension.</p> <p>Strange what changes a few years could wreak in a female! There had been nothing remarkable in little Marianne Treen before she went south to boarding-school: in fact Tom could distinctly recall that he and Jack and Harry Denver had thought her a silly creature, with freckles on her nose, and a tiresome way of intruding where girls were not wanted. Her departure from Yorkshire left their withers unwrung; and since she spent her holidays in London, with her grandmama, they were very soon able to forget her.</p> <p>But she had come back to Yorkshire. She had enjoyed a brilliant London season, and when most of the haut ton had gone to Brighton, Mrs Treen had brought her home to Treen Hall, and the neighbourhood had renewed their acquaintance with her at one of the assemblies at High Harrowgate. A stunning shock that had been to all the young gentlemen for miles around, for who would have supposed that this dazzling beauty was none other than freckled little Marianne, who was used to whine: &#x2018;Let me come with you! Oh, pray, let me come too!'</p> <p>They rarely had let her, and now she had her revenge on them. Only she was too sweet and too gay to care for that, and if she did favour some more than others it was easy to see that she used her best endeavours to be impartial.</p> <p>Jack and Tom were her favourites, as they were certainly the most assiduous, of her courtiers. Everyone laughed at this, and they were roasted a little for doing everything together, even when it came to falling in love for the first time. That did nothing to soothe exacerbated tempers. It was a strange and a deplorable circumstance that one's relatives were unable to see when one was in earnest, but, on the contrary, laboured under the delusion that if one had not yet come down from Oxford one was too young to think of marriage.</p> <p>Each knew himself to be an eligible suitor. Perhaps Jack had a little the advantage over Tom, for his father was a baronet. But Tom's father was the Squire, which counted for something, and Tom was his only son, whereas Jack had two younger brothers to be provided for.</p> <p>At first their courtship had been unattended by any rancour. They were agreed that Marianne was incomparable, and their rivalry had been conducted in the friendliest spirit. Perhaps neither knew when the change had crept into their relationship with one another. Perhaps Jack was jealous of Tom's superior height, and breadth of shoulder (sure to appeal to a female!); perhaps Tom envied Jack his air of elegance, and his handsome profile. Whatever the cause, the rift appeared between them. They had become hostile, each eyeing the other with suspicion, each on the watch for any cause for offence. A dozen times they had come within an ace of indulging in a maul; but never until this disastrous night had they considered the possibility of settling their quarrel at dawn, in Stanhope's Clearing by tradition an honourable meeting-place.</p> <p>That Marianne would choose one or other of them before the summer ended neither doubted. The only question was which it would be, and this made it of paramount importance that neither should steal an unfair advantage over the other. After one or two squabbles they had agreed to this or so Tom had believed, until on this night of the Treens' Dress Party he had beheld with his own eyes the proof of Jack's perfidy. Both had meant to send Marianne a posy of flowers to carry at the ball, with a suitable message attached to the holder: which posy she chose would clearly indicate her heart's preference. Tom had bullied the Squire's head gardener into making up an exquisite bouquet of pink roses and sweet-peas. He had ridden over to Treen Hall himself that morning, to leave the tribute with the Treens' quelling butler, and the most shocking mischance had occurred. The mare had been stung by a horsefly, and Tom, that bruising rider, lost in some beatific dream, and riding with a loose rein and his head in the clouds, had abruptly parted company with Bess. Alas for the delicate bouquet grasped in his right hand! A shower of petals in the road, a dismal array of broken stalks in the filigree holder: that was all that remained of it.</p> <p>He had only just caught Bess when, as ill-fortune would have it, Jack came driving along the road from Melbury Court in his smart new tilbury. A bouquet of yellow roses lay on the seat beside him, so that there was no need to enquire his errand.</p> <p>Three months earlier Jack would have roared with laughter at Tom's mishap; today Jack was politeness itself, and not even the sight of that abject posy did more than make his lip quiver. Jack had had the infernal impudence to behave with magnanimity. He had said that since misfortune had overtaken Tom he should not present his own bouquet. This was precisely what Tom had been about to demand as his due, under the terms of their agreement. He said so, hating Jack for his punctiliousness. So Jack smiled in a slighting way, and had more than hinted that only a cork-brained fellow like Tom would have thought of offering pink roses to a goddess whose hair was a glorious Titian red.</p> <p>Tom had brooded over it all the afternoon, but it was not then that the thought of calling Jack out had even remotely occurred to him. It hadn't really occurred to him when, on arriving at Treen Hall that evening, he had seen Marianne, adorable in a cloud of jonquil gauze over a white satin robe, holding in one gloved hand a posy of yellow roses. If any reasoned thought found room in his brain, it was merely a vague resolve to give Jack a leveller at the first convenient opportunity if (for Jack was a clever boxer) Jack did not first plant him a heavy facer.</p> <p>It was a very grand party, with several London swells, who were staying at Treen Hall, much in evidence. At any other time, Tom, aspiring to fashion, would have taken careful note of the folds of the neckcloth worn by the Tulip talking to Mrs Treen, or regarded with envy the cut of the coat moulded across the shoulders of the gentleman from London who was dancing with Marianne. He would not have been jealous of this personage, for all his handsome face, and exquisite bearing, for he was quite old thirty at least, Tom judged and probably already the father of a hopeful family.</p> <p>All his jealousy, all his seething rancour, was reserved for Jack, his closest friend. Mr Treen's excellent champagne did nothing to assuage it. Before an hour had elapsed it must have been a very obtuse person who failed to realize that the two handsome boys from the Manor and Melbury Court were itching to be at one another's throats.</p> <p>And then Jack, stepping back politely for an elderly gentleman to pass him, trod on Tom's toes, and made him spill his champagne.</p> <p><b>2</b></p> <p>Somehow they were confronting one another in the small saloon that led out of the ballroom, and Tom was cursing Jack, and Jack, instead of punching him in the ribs, or meekly apologizing for his clumsiness, was standing straight and stiff, white-faced and close-lipped, his pleasant grey eyes as cold and as hard as the granite of the country. Then Tom had uttered the words from which there could be no retreat. &#x2018;I shall send my friends to wait on yours!' he said, in a grand way that was only marred by his shaking voice of fury.</p> <p>Dear, good Harry Denver, who had seen the encounter, and had followed the injured parties into the saloon, tried to make peace, urging them not to be gudgeons, to remember where they were.</p> <p>&#x2018;Harry, will you act for me?' demanded Tom.</p> <p>Poor Harry stuttered and floundered. &#x2018;Now, Tom, you know this is the outside of enough! Jack meant no harm! Jack, for God's sake !'</p> <p>&#x2018;I am perfectly ready to meet Mr Crawley, when and where he pleases!' replied Jack, in a chill, brittle voice.</p> <p>&#x2018;Be good enough to name your friends, Mr Frith!' said Tom, not to be outdone in formality.</p> <p>&#x2018;Jack, you're not three parts foxed!' Harry said urgently. &#x2018;Don't be such a damned fool, man!'</p> <p>Then he saw that they were no longer alone. The gentleman from London, who had been waltzing with Marianne, had come into the saloon, and closed the door behind him. All three young men glared at him, the hostility of the native towards the stranger patent in their eyes.</p> <p>&#x2018;You must forgive me!' he said affably. &#x2018;An affair of honour, I collect? So much better to shut the door, don't you agree? Can I be of service to either of you?'</p> <p>They stared at him. Harry, in desperate need of an ally, blurted out the ostensible cause of the quarrel, and besought the gentleman from London to assure the sworn enemies that they were behaving like idiots.</p> <p>Jack, who had been mentally passing in review his acquaintances in the district, and rejecting them all as being unsuitable candidates for the post of second, said haughtily: &#x2018;I am persuaded no man of honour would advise another to refuse a challenge. Of course, if Mr Crawley cares to withdraw his rash words '</p> <p>This was a studied insult, as Tom well knew, for Jack was by far the better shot. He snapped out one word: &#x2018;No!'</p> <p>&#x2018;But they mustn't fight!' Harry protested, distress writ plain on his honest countenance. &#x2018;Sir, tell them so!'</p> <p>The gentleman from London said apologetically: &#x2018;But I am in agreement with Mr Frith. A man of honour, sir, cannot refuse such a challenge.'</p> <p>Jack looked at him with a certain approval, but said stiffly: &#x2018;You have the advantage of me, sir.'</p> <p>&#x2018;My name is Kilham,' said the gentleman from London. &#x2018;May I again offer my services? I shall be happy to act for you, Mr Frith.'</p> <p>Three pairs of young eyes stared at him. One might live remote from London, but one was not such a Johnny Raw that one had not heard of Sir Gavin Kilham, friend of princes, member of the Bow Window set at White's, amateur of sport, Nonesuch amongst whips, arbiter of fashion. No wonder the folds of his neckcloth baffled the closest scrutiny! no wonder his coat fitted him like a glove!</p> <p>Jack, bemused at the thought of having such an exalted person for his second, swallowed, and only just managed to achieve a creditable bow; Tom ground his teeth in rage that Jack should yet again have all the luck; and Harry, in relief, supposed that Beau Kilham must know as well as any man what ought now to be done. He ventured to say: &#x2018;I I shall call upon you, sir, at your convenience!'</p> <p>&#x2018;That might be a trifle awkward,' said Sir Gavin, to whom the tragic situation seemed to be the merest commonplace. &#x2018;I am only a guest in this house, you see. Let us settle it here and now!'</p> <p>Harry, who had a dim notion that the correct behaviour of a second was to seek a reconciliation between the principals, looked doubtful, but the prospective duellists emphatically applauded the suggestion.</p> <p>Sir Gavin, drawing out his snuff-box, flicked it open, and took a delicate pinch. &#x2018;Since we, sir, have the choice, we shall elect to fight with pistols, at twenty-five yards, tomorrow, at an hour and a place which I shall ask you to suggest.'</p> <p>Deep trouble was in Harry's face, for the longer range gave all the advantage to the better shot. Before he could speak, Jack said, quite insufferably, Tom considered: &#x2018;I prefer to fight Mr Crawley at a range of twelve yards, sir.'</p> <p>&#x2018;Well, I won't fight you at twelve yards!' retorted Tom furiously. &#x2018;Twenty-five, and be damned to you!'</p> <p>&#x2018;Tom, do, for God's sake ! Now, listen, you crazy fools, this is nonsense! The quarrel can be composed in a trice!' exclaimed Harry.</p> <p>They rounded on him, all their pent-up feelings finding expression in the loathing with which they commanded him to hold his tongue.</p> <p>So there was nothing for poor Harry to do but to appoint the time and the place, both of which Sir Gavin accepted with the utmost amiability.</p> <p>Then a paralysing thought occurred to all three young gentlemen.</p> <p>&#x2018;The the weapons?' uttered Harry, exchanging an anguished glance with Tom.</p> <p>For a moment no one said anything. Sir Gavin's lazy eyes were lowered to the contemplation of his charming snuff-box, and if his lips twitched it was so tiny a betrayal that it passed unnoticed. Bitter reflections on the ways of fathers, who kept under lock and key their duelling-pistols (if indeed they owned such things) possessed the minds of Jack and Tom. Anyone would have thought that a prudent parent would have given his son a good pair of Manton pistols instead of a pair of shot-guns, and would have taught him how to conduct himself in such a situation as this. Neither Sir John nor the Squire had made the least push to be of real service to their heirs; and intimate knowledge of both gentlemen could only lead those heirs to face the disagreeable fact that an appeal to them now would end in nothing but the summary end to their quarrel.</p> <p>Harry, anxious though he might be to stop the affair, was not going to allow the gentleman from London to suppose that his principal owned no duelling-pistols. He said that unfortunately Tom's pistols had been sent back to the maker for a trifling repair. Jack was not going to be outdone by this sort of thing, and since he could not think of any reason that was not grossly plagiaristic for failing to produce a pair of pistols of his own, he said, with an odiously curling lip: &#x2018;Strange that I should not have been permitted to see Mr Crawley's weapons!'</p> <p>&#x2018;You have none either, so be damned to that humbug!' instantly replied Tom.</p> <p>&#x2018;In that case,' said Sir Gavin, restoring the snuff-box to his pocket, &#x2018;I will be responsible for the weapons.

Waters lives in London.</p><b>ONE</b><p>I first saw Hundreds Hall when I was ten years old. It was the summer after the war, and the Ayreses still had most of their money then, were still big people in the district. The event was an Empire Day f�te: I stood with a line of other village children making a Boy Scout salute while Mrs Ayres and the Colonel went past us, handing out commemorative medals; afterwards we sat to tea with our parents at long tables on what I suppose was the south lawn. Mrs Ayres would have been twenty-four or -five, her husband a few years older; their little girl, Susan, would have been about six. They must have made a very handsome family, but my memory of them is vague. I recall most vividly the house itself, which struck me as an absolute mansion. I remember its lovely ageing details: the worn red brick, the cockled window glass, the weathered sandstone edgings. They made it look blurred and slightly uncertain&#x2014;like an ice, I thought, just beginning to melt in the sun.<br>There were no trips inside, of course. The doors and French windows stood open, but each had a rope or a ribbon tied across it; the lavatories set aside for our use were the grooms&#x2019; and the gardeners&#x2019;, in the stable block. My mother, however, still had friends among the servants, and when the tea was finished and people were given the run of the grounds, she took me quietly into the house by a side door, and we spent a little time with the cook and the kitchen girls. The visit impressed me terribly. The kitchen was a basement one, reached by a cool vaulted corridor with something of the feel of a castle dungeon. An extraordinary number of people seemed to be coming and going along it with hampers and trays. The girls had such a mountain of crockery to wash, my mother rolled up her sleeves to help them; and to my very great delight, as a reward for her labour I was allowed to take my pick of the jellies and &#x2018;shapes&#x2019; that had come back uneaten from the f�te. I was put to sit at a deal-topped table, and given a spoon from the family&#x2019;s own drawer&#x2014;a heavy thing of dulled silver, its bowl almost bigger than my mouth.<br>But then came an even greater treat. High up on the wall of the vaulted passage was a junction-box of wires and bells, and when one of these bells was set ringing, calling the parlourmaid upstairs, she took me with her, so that I might peep past the green baize curtain that separated the front of the house from the back. I could stand and wait for her there, she said, if I was very good and quiet. I must only be sure to keep behind the curtain, for if the Colonel or the missus were to see me, there&#x2019;d be a row.<br>I was an obedient child, as a rule. But the curtain opened onto the corner junction of two marble-floored passages, each one filled with marvellous things; and once she had disappeared softly in one direction, I took a few daring steps in the other. The thrill of it was astonishing. I don&#x2019;t mean the simple thrill of trespass, I mean the thrill of the house itself, which came to me from every surface&#x2014;from the polish on the floor, the patina on wooden chairs and cabinets, the bevel of a looking-glass, the scroll of a frame. I was drawn to one of the dustless white walls, which had a decorative plaster border, a representation of acorns and leaves. I had never seen anything like it, outside of a church, and after a second of looking it over I did what strikes me now as a dreadful thing: I worked my fingers around one of the acorns and tried to prise it from its setting; and when that failed to release it, I got out my penknife and dug away with that. I didn&#x2019;t do it in a spirit of vandalism. I wasn&#x2019;t a spiteful or destructive boy. It was simply that, in admiring the house, I wanted to possess a piece of it&#x2014;or rather, as if the admiration itself, which I suspected a more ordinary child would not have felt, entitled me to it. I was like a man, I suppose, wanting a lock of hair from the head of a girl he had suddenly and blindingly become enamoured of.<br>I&#x2019;m afraid the acorn gave at last, though less cleanly than I&#x2019;d been expecting, with a tug of fibre and a fall of white powder and grit; I remember that as disappointing. Possibly I&#x2019;d imagined it to be made of marble.<br>But nobody came, nobody caught me. It was, as they say, the work of a moment. I put the acorn in my pocket, and slipped back behind the curtain. The parlourmaid returned a minute later and took me back downstairs; my mother and I said goodbye to the kitchen staff, and rejoined my father in the garden. I felt the hard plaster lump in my pocket, now, with a sort of sick excitement. I&#x2019;d begun to be anxious that Colonel Ayres, a frightening man, would discover the damage and stop the f�te. But the afternoon ran on without incident until the bluish drawing-in of dusk. My parents and I joined other Lidcote people for the long walk home, the bats flitting and wheeling with us along the lanes as if whirled on invisible strings.<br>My mother found the acorn, of course, eventually. I had been drawing it in and out of my pocket, and it had left a chalky trail on the grey flannel of my shorts. When she understood what the queer little thing in her hand was, she almost wept. She didn&#x2019;t smack me, or tell my father; she never had the heart for arguments. Instead she looked at me, with her tearful eyes, as if baffled and ashamed.<br>&#x2018;You ought to know better, a clever lad like you,&#x2019; I expect she said.<br>People were always saying things like that to me when I was young. My parents, my uncles, my schoolmasters&#x2014;all the various adults who interested themselves in my career. The words used to drive me into secret rages, because on the one hand I wanted desperately to live up to my own reputation for cleverness, and on the other it seemed very unfair, that that cleverness, which I had never asked for, could be turned into something with which to cut me down.<br>The acorn was put on the fire. I found the blackened nub of it among the clinker, next day. That must have been the last grand year for Hundreds Hall, anyway. The following Empire Day f�te was given by another family, in one of the neighbouring big houses; Hundreds had started its steady decline. Soon afterwards the Ayreses&#x2019; daughter died, and Mrs Ayres and the Colonel began to live less publicly. I dimly remember the births of their next two children, Caroline and Roderick&#x2014;but by then I was at Leamington College, and busy with bitter little battles of my own. My mother died when I was fifteen. She had had miscarriage after miscarriage, it turned out, all through my childhood, and the last one killed her. My father lived just long enough to see me graduate from medical school and return to Lidcote a qualified man. Colonel Ayres died a few years later&#x2014;an aneurism, I think.<br>With his death, Hundreds Hall withdrew even further from the world. The gates of the park were kept almost permanently closed. The solid brown stone boundary wall, though not especially high, was high enough to seem forbidding. And for all that the house was such a grand one, there was no spot, on any of the lanes in that part of Warwickshire, from which it could be glimpsed. I sometimes thought of it, tucked away in there, as I passed the wall on my rounds&#x2014;picturing it always as it had seemed to me that day in 1919, with its handsome brick faces, and its cool marble passages, each one filled with marvellous things.<br>So when I did see the house again&#x2014;almost thirty years on from that first visit, and shortly after the end of another war&#x2014;the changes in it appalled me. It was the purest chance that took me out there, for the Ayreses were registered with my partner, David Graham; but he was busy with an emergency case that day, so when the family sent out for a doctor the request was passed on to me. My heart began to sink almost the moment I let myself into the park. I remembered a long approach to the house through neat rhododendron and laurel, but the park was now so overgrown and untended, my small car had to fight its way down the drive. When I broke free of the bushes at last and found myself on a sweep of lumpy gravel with the Hall directly ahead of me, I put on the brake, and gaped in dismay. The house was smaller than in memory, of course&#x2014;not quite the mansion I&#x2019;d been recalling&#x2014;but I&#x2019;d been expecting that. What horrified me were the signs of decay. Sections of the lovely weathered edgings seemed to have fallen completely away, so that the house&#x2019;s uncertain Georgian outline was even more tentative than before. Ivy had spread, then patchily died, and hung like tangled rat&#x2019;s-tail hair. The steps leading up to the broad front door were cracked, with weeds growing lushly up through the seams.<br>I parked my car, climbed out, and almost feared to slam the door. The place, for so large and solid a structure, felt precarious. No one appeared to have heard me arrive, so after a little hesitation I went crunching over the gravel and gingerly climbed the cracked stone steps. It was a hot, still summer&#x2019;s day&#x2014;so windless that when I tugged on the tarnished old brass and ivory bell-pull I caught the ring of it, pure and clear, but distant, as if in the belly of the house. The ring was immediately followed by the faint, gruff barking of a dog.<br>The barks were very soon cut off, and for another long minute there was silence. Then, from somewhere to my right, I heard the scrape of an irregular footstep, and a moment later the son of the family, Roderick, appeared around the corner of the house. He squinted over at me with some suspicion, until noticing the bag in my hand. Drawing a collapsed-looking cigarette from his mouth he called, &#x2018;You&#x2019;re the doctor, are you? We were expecting Dr Graham.&#x2019;<br>His tone was friendly enough, but had a touch of languor to it; as if he were bored by the sight of me already. I left the steps and went over to him, introducing myself as Graham&#x2019;s partner, explaining about Graham&#x2019;s emergency case. He answered blandly, &#x2018;Well, it&#x2019;s good of you to come out. On a Sunday, too; and such a filthy hot one. Come this way, would you? It&#x2019;s quicker than going right through the house. I&#x2019;m Roderick Ayres, by the way.&#x2019;<br>We had in fact met before, on more than one occasion. But he&#x2019;d clearly forgotten that, and as we moved off he gave me his hand for a perfunctory shake. His fingers felt queer against mine, rough as crocodile in some spots, oddly smooth in others: his hands had been burnt, I knew, in a wartime accident, along with a good part of his face. The scars aside, he was handsome: taller than me, but, at twenty-four, still boyish and slender. He was dressed boyishly too, in an open-necked shirt, summer trousers, and stained canvas shoes. He walked unhurriedly, and with a noticeable limp.<br>He said as we went, &#x2018;You know why we called you, I suppose?&#x2019;<br>I said, &#x2018;I was told, for one of your maids.&#x2019;<br>&#x2018;One of our maids! I like that. There&#x2019;s only the one: our girl, Betty. Some stomach problem, it seems to be.&#x2019; He looked dubious. &#x2018;I don&#x2019;t know. My mother, my sister, and I tend to manage without doctors as a rule. We muddle through with colds and headaches. But I gather that neglecting the servants is a capital offence these days; they&#x2019;re to get better treatment than us, apparently. So we thought we ought to send for someone. Watch your step just here, look.&#x2019;<br>He had taken me along a gravelled terrace that ran the length of the north side of the Hall; he indicated a spot where the terrace had subsided, making for treacherous dips and cracks. I picked my way around them, interested to have been given a chance to see this side of the house&#x2014;but aghast, again, at how badly the place had been allowed to decline. The garden was a chaos of nettle and bindweed. There was a faint but definite whiff of blocked drains. The windows we passed were streaked and dusty; all were closed, and most were shuttered, except for a pair of glass doors that stood open at the top of a set of flying stone steps wound about with convolvulus. They gave me a view of a large untidy room, a desk with a mess of papers on it, an edge of brocade curtain . . . That was all I had time to see. We had reached a narrow service doorway, and Roderick was standing aside to let me pass.<br>&#x2018;Go on, would you?&#x2019; he said, gesturing with one of his scarred hands. &#x2018;My sister&#x2019;s downstairs. She&#x2019;ll show you to Betty, and fill you in.&#x2019;<br>Only later, recalling his injured leg, would I guess that he must not have wanted me to see him struggling with stairs. As it was, I thought his manner rather casual, and I went past him, saying nothing. At once, I heard him crunching quietly away in his rubber-soled shoes.<br>But I went quietly, myself. This narrow doorway, I had realised, was the one through which my mother had more or less smuggled me, all those years before. I remembered the bare stone stairway it led to, and, following the steps down, I found myself in the dim vaulted passage that had so impressed me then. But here was another disappointment. I had been picturing this passage as something like a crypt or a dungeon; in fact its walls were the glossy cream-and-green of police- and fire-stations, there was a strip of coconut-matting on the flagstone floor, and a mop sat sourly in a bucket. Nobody emerged to greet me, but to my right a half-open door offered a glimpse of the kitchen, so I went softly over and looked inside. Yet another damp squib: I found a large lifeless room with Victorian counters and mortuary surfaces, all brutally scoured and scrubbed. Only the old deal table&#x2014;the very table, by the look of it, where I had eaten my jellies and &#x2018;shapes&#x2019;&#x2014;recalled the excitement of that first visit. It was also the only thing in the room to bear any sign of activity, for there was a small pile of muddy vegetables put out on it, together with a bowl of water and a knife&#x2014;the water discoloured, and the knife wet, as if someone had recently started the task and been called away.<br>I stepped back; and my shoe must have creaked, or scuffed against the coconut-matting. There came again the gruff excited barking of a dog&#x2014;alarmingly close, this time&#x2014;and a second later an elderly black Labrador burst from somewhere into the passage and began hurtling towards me. I stood still with my bag raised while it barked and pranced around me, and soon a young woman appeared behind it, saying mildly, &#x2018;All right, you idiotic creature, that&#x2019;s enough! Gyp! Enough!&#x2014;I&#x2019;m so sorry.&#x2019; She drew nearer, and I recognised Roderick&#x2019;s sister, Caroline. &#x2018;I can&#x2019;t bear a leaping dog, and he knows it. Gyp!&#x2019; She reached forward to give him a swipe upon his haunches with the back of her hand; and at that he subsided.<br>&#x2018;Little imbecile,&#x2019; she said, tugging his ears with a look of indulgence. &#x2018;It&#x2019;s touching really. He thinks every stranger&#x2019;s come to cut our throats and make off with the family silver. We haven&#x2019;t the heart to tell him the silver&#x2019;s all been popped. I thought we were getting Dr Graham. You&#x2019;re Dr Faraday. We&#x2019;ve never been properly introduced, have we?&#x2019;<br>She smiled as she spoke, and offered me her hand. Her grip was firmer than her brother&#x2019;s had been, and more sincere.<br>I&#x2019;d only ever seen her at a distance before, at county events, or on the streets of Warwick and Leamington. She was older than Roderick, twenty-six or twenty-seven, and I&#x2019;d regularly heard her referred to locally as &#x2018;rather hearty&#x2019;, a &#x2018;natural spinster&#x2019;, a &#x2018;clever girl&#x2019;&#x2014;in other words she was noticeably plain, over-tall for a woman, with thickish legs and ankles. ...</p></p><h2>Advanced Surf Fitness for High Performance Surfing</h2><p><p>Aimed at surfers of all ages and abilities, <i>Advanced</i> <i>Surf Fitness for High Performance Surfing</i> offers a complete training package designed to take your surfing to the next level.

A sugar-beet crashes through a young woman&#39;s windscreen. A boy sets fire to a barn. A pair of itinerant labourers sit by a lake, talking about shovels and sex, while fighter-planes fly low overhead and prepare for war. These aren&#39;t the sort of things you imagine happening to someone like you. But sometimes they do. Set in the flat and threatened fenland landscape, where the sky is dominant and the sea lurks just beyond the horizon, these delicate, dangerous, and sometimes deeply funny stories tell of things buried and unearthed, of familiar places made strange, and of lives where much is hidden, much is at risk, and tender moments are hard-won.</p><p>Jon McGregor is the author of the critically acclaimed If Nobody Speaks of Remarkable Things, So Many Ways to Begin and Even the Dogs.

In this collection the vast skies and silts of the Lincolnshire fens are sensually evoked and the austerely beautiful landscape exposes the most intimate details of his characters' lives; their secrets, their crimes and desires. Underneath that which is radically quotidian, he captures our unique and unusual selves * Sarah Hall * Pure joy just about sums up Jon McGregor's collection of short stories ... McGregor's genius keeps you on the edge of your seat until the penultimate paragraph ... McGregor is the nearest thing you will ever come across to a literary Beethoven. Words go beyond beings tools of his trade and become an orchestrated, inspired and precisely designed tone poem for each creative idea ... One of the most perfect pieces of written English I have ever come across * Sunday Express * Set in and around the fens, these wickedly brilliant stories are as black as the local soil ... Jon McGregor's direct, unadorned style couldn't be more suited to this comfortless landscape, a place of cooling towers, drainage ditches and endless skies ...

But very, very good indeed * Daily Mail * Fans of his novels, in which he has finessed his own inimitable style, won't be disappointed. They will find all the linguistic risk, the formal experimentation, the authorial compassion of his earlier works - and more ...

There is a precision and a poetry to his prose. Life, inner and outer, is so meticulously dissected that events appear to happen in slow motion.

This collection is McGregor's most lyrical work to date, and some of the shorter stories in the collection, such as "Dig a Hole", "Feeling Complexity" and "Thoughtful" , read like bursts of intense prose poetry ... a work of tremendous scope and ambition.

The reaction of Bohemian glassmakers to Regency cut glass led to the development of coloured glassware which was immediately copied in turn by English glassmakers and exhibited in all its glory at the Crystal Palace Exhibition of 1851. In the second half of the century the great glassmaking tradition of Venice influenced important glassmakers of the calibre of Apsley Pellatt, John Northwood and Harry Powell. The prosperity of Victorian England attracted Bohemian engravers, French enamellers and gilders who played a vital role in establishing this period of manufacture as the Golden Age of glassmaking. This major publication has established itself as the standard work on nineteenth century British glass. In addition to cut, engraved, cameo and etched glass, the information on personalities, working conditions and the operations of the glasshouse gives the collector an all-round view of</p><p>Produced as a reference for members of the Antique Collector's Club of Great Britain, this veritable encyclopedia of the 19th-century British glass industry far surpasses previous works dealing with this period.

The book is based on his successful course in sharp focus painting and is presented as a series of exercises and demonstrations. After an initial discussion of materials and perspective, the author offers a series of preparatory exercises for you to do: line drawing of simple and complicated shapes; black and white drawing in tone, using charcoal pencil and Conte; black and white value painting in oils; color value painting, in which you paint a color wheel, a color value chart, and a color mixing chart. When you have completed these preliminary exercises, you are ready to actually start painting. Step-by-step, the author guides you through the details of rendering a color still life, an all-white painting, an all-black painting, still lifes made up of objects with rough texture (wood, iron, paper, stone) and smooth texture (clear and colored glass, silver, gold), and a still life with reflected light. Then the author shows how to use different techniques: speed painting, monochrome wet-into-wet, drawing with a brush and thinned oil paint, painting still lifes under colored light, and finally, the techniques of glazing and scumbling. &#34;The author then invites you to look over his shoulder as he paints, from start to finish, trompe l&#39;oeil still life, tabletop still life, and outdoor still life. This section is further enhanced by a gallery of the author&#39;s work reproduced in full color.&#34; Includes 200 black and white illustrations, 40 full-color plates, glossary and index.</p><p></p><h2>Illustrated Treasury of Read-Aloud Myths and Legends: More than 40 of the World&#39;s Best-Loved Myths and Legends Including Greek, Roman, Celtic, Scandinavian, Indian, Mexican, and Many More</h2><p>Read-Aloud Myths and Legends collects time-honored stories from the Greek, Roman, and Celtic traditions including: &#34;The Adventures of Odysseus,&#34; &#34;Pandora&#39;s Box,&#34; &#34;Psyche and Cupid,&#34; &#34;Lugh, the Sun God,&#34; &#34;Queen Maeve and the Wild Sow,&#34; and much more.

He made signs that said STOP. He made signs that said GO. He made signs that said FAST. And signs that said SLOW.<br><br> </p><p>When the signs in Little Town were old, the mayor said, "we need all new signs." Mr. Pine painted all new signs in one week. "I will put them up," he said, but he could not find his glasses. He put the signs up anyway.<br><br> </p><p>The signs were all MIXED-UP! Little Town was all mixed-up! Where were Mr. Pine's glasses? Who had his glasses? How did he solve the problem of all those mixed-up signs?</p></p><p>Mr. Pine makes signs: "stop," "go," "pets for sale," "gas, 33 cents" (this book was first published in 1961), and more. Little Town is, in fact, plastered with the industrious painter's handiwork, ensuring social order in the way that signs do: "Yes, Little Town had all the signs a town could need." However, when the mayor deems it time to replace the aging, sunbaked, windblown signs, trouble begins. Mr. Pine is pleased to make new signs for the town: "The next week Mr. Pine painted and painted and painted." All would have been well if Mr. Pine had not lost his glasses and installed all the new signs in the wrong places. The sign on the mayor's door said, "This Way to the Zoo!" The sign over the bank said "Bread!" <p> Children will adore Leonard Kessler's short chapter books.

After considering Paul's importance and influence, and the important sources for the study of Paul, the volume covers the following key topics: the earliest period of Christianity - from Jesus to Paul; Paul's life before and after his 'conversion'; his individual letters; the major elements of his theology; his attitude to Israel and the Jewish law; perspectives on the Pauline assemblies, including their socio-economic location, meeting places, and attitudes towards women; and Paul's legacy in the New Testament and beyond. <br> The volume has been revised throughout and fully updated with respect to bibliography, and to presenting the latest debates surrounding Paul's thought in a manageable format - including those around 'old' and 'new' perspectives, with a new section on the 'radical' new Jewish perspective, and those related to the socio-economic status and character of the Pauline assemblies. The helpful study questions and reading lists have also been revised.</p></p><p>This is the perfect student introduction to the study of Paul, and his writings.<b>David G. Horrell</b> is Professor of New Testament at the University of Exeter, UK.</p><h2>Sons for the Return Home (Talanoa: Contemporary Pacific Literature, 11)</h2><p>Originally published in 1973, this story of star-crossed lovers spotlights the complex nature of love, freedom, and racism in New Zealand. Samoan writer Albert Wendt's first novel, <i>Sons for the Return Home,</i> has long been out of print. Yet, readers continue to respond to the clarity of vision in this simple, powerful story of cross-cultural encounter.</p><p>The two loversboth university studentsin this novel face many cultural difficulties. She is a white New Zealander, blonde, outgoing, daughter of a successful businessman; he is the son of xenophobic Somoan immigrants to New Zealand, dark, reticent and bitter about his tenuous position as a "coconut islander" in white society. Indeed, this is also the story of two conflicting South Pacific nationsNew Zealand and Samoawhose inhabitants tend to translate racial pride into racist contempt for others. Told in the flat, passionless voice of the nameless boy, this allegory, rich in both history and geographic detail, demonstrates the problems of cultural cohabitation. Though his writing is slightly uneven and too often cliched, Wendt, a native Samoan and professor of literature, offers a fine, compassionate tale. <br>Copyright 1987 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Verse by Verse Commentary on the Book of Genesis (The Enduring Word Commentary Series)</h2><p>A verse-by-verse, chapter-by-chapter commentary on the book of Genesis.

California tile makers excelled in their craft during the first half of the twentieth century, producing richly patterned designs for building facades, interiors, garden ornamentation, furniture, and even serving pieces. "Old California" art tile is rich in tradition and innovation. Over 1700 color images in two volumes, comprise this comprehensive collection, with essays on early California tile companies. Arranged alphabetically by company, this volume includes hundreds of tiles from: Hispano-Moresque, Kraftile, Helen Greenleaf Lane, L.A. Pressed Brick, Malibu, Markoff, Muresque, Pacific, Pomona, Poxon, Rhead, S &amp; S, Taylor, Tropico, Tudor, Walrich, West Coast, Woolenius, and tile furnishings and crafts from Cellini-Craft, Hillside Pottery, and Monterey Furniture. A companion volume covers potteries from Acme to Handcraft. Both volumes are enriched by rarely seen archival photographs including historical site installations and have useful guides to tile terminology and techniques. This landmark publication, designed to broaden appreciation of this colorful and varied aspect of American decorative arts, will serve to inspire and guide architects, designers, collectors, and historians alike</p><p></p><h2>The Sea Painter&#39;s World: The New Marine Art of Geoff Hunt</h2><p>This timely follow-up to Conway's highly successful <i>Marine Art of Geoff Hunt</i> presents the considerable artistic output of Britain's leading marine painter since 2003. Heavily illustrated with images ranging from large paintings to sketchbook drawings, with text written by the artist himself, the book sets Geoff's work in a broadly geographical context, showcasing his plein-air work alongside exhaustively researched maritime history paintings, such as the definitive <i>Mary Rose</i>, to which he owes his standing as Britain's leading marine artist.</p><p><b>Geoff Hunt</b> is a former President of the Royal Society of Marine Artists. His work is represented in public and private collections worldwide, and Geoff is an expert on the Navy of Nelson and<br>Patrick O'Brian. In 2004, <i>The Marine Art of Geoff Hunt</i> was published to much acclaim, presenting over 100 of the artist's key works from a thirty-year career. Geoff's studio is on the site of Nelson's house at Merton Place.<br>Another magnificent volume of the work of one of the undisputed foremost maritime artists of our own time, well-known to many of our readers, this one covering many of Geoff Hunt&#39;s recent paintings. The last time I had the pleasure of receiving a volume of his paintings was three years ago, the book written and produced together with Brian Lavery on HMS Surprise, containing all the cover paintings of the Patrick O&#39;Brian books as well as a wealth of others. This new book covers Geoff Hunt&#39;s work since then as well as some earlier paintings. In contrast to the HMS Surprise volume, there is greater diversity of subject here. Though the artist&#39;s home period is clearly that of the late 18th and early 19th centuries, we are taken right back to the 16th century with his definitive study of the Mary Rose based on all the researched information now available (culminating in his now well-known 2009 painting reproduced in the book) and right up to the present day HMS Bulwark at the International Fleet review on 28th June 2005, HMS Dragon building at VT Portsmouth and HMS Ark Royal in drydock at Portsmouth in May 2009. Modern sail and port scenes are covered as well. Not only is this book as stunning as one would expect for the many beautifully reproduced paintings, but it also affords an insight into the creative processes of the marine artist himself. It takes us through his sources, right back to the 16th Century Anthony Rolls in the case of the Mary Rose painting and research, to preliminary and developing sketches for the final painting and into the artist&#39;s studio itself. Several chapters are written as case studies of the evolution of final works of art; apart from HMS Bulwark and Mary Rose we have `The Mediterranean - Case Study III : Jack Aubrey&#39;s Port Mahon in 1800&#39;; `In the Wake of Admiral Nelson - Case Study IV : The Battle of the Nile&#39;; `North America - Case Study V : Chasing the Rainbow&#39; and similar. There are several subjects here of particular interest to American members, such as the CSS Alabama sailing from Cherbourg in June 1864 to fight the USS Kearsage and a fine study of the big Humphreys frigate USS United States making passage in a good sailing breeze under all plain sail. Then, `Under Fire off Manhattan&#39;, `Ranger Goes a-Roving&#39;, `Hancock and Fox&#39;, `The USS Chesapeake leaving Boston Harbor&#39;, finally `USS Constitution at the Battle of Tripoli 1804&#39; and the cover painting for James Nelson&#39;s The Continental Risque. Trafalgar is to the fore, and the subsequent Strachan&#39;s Action. Our readers will have noticed that Jack Aubrey is still very much in evidence, but so is Hornblower, with `HMS Hotspur off Brest 1803&#39;; `Dangerous waters: HMS Renown; HMS Lydia hove down and refitting in the Pacific and `HMS Sutherland&#39;s Last Battle&#39;. There are many more fascinating subjects, from racing tea clippers (The Great Tea Race of 1866&#39;) to WWI battlecruisers (`HMS Indomitable entering Grand Harbour, Valetta&#39;). The cover image depicts Sir George Collier&#39;s Squadron in Penobscot Bay, 14th August 1779 Another beautiful book to treasure, from Conway&#39;s excellent production team and from one of the very foremost maritime artists working today, the incomparable Geoff Hunt. -- Roger Marsh * Historical Naval Fiction *</p><h2>The Character of Theology: An Introduction to Its Nature, Task, and Purpose</h2><p>Theology done in today's context is strikingly different from past evangelical approaches.

Clamp also includes three artists whose roles shift for each series: Mokona, Tsubaki Nekoi, and Satsuki Igarashi. Almost 100 million volumes of Clamp manga have been sold worldwide.Starred Review. This experimental sci-fi work from CLAMP reads like a romantic version of <i>Akira</i>. In the far future, a mysterious government organization monitors and confines psychic children in the Clover program. A professional singer and one-leaf ranked psychic named Ora has only the ability to predict her own death. The most powerful psychic in the world, a four-leaf girl named Sue lives a life of voluntary isolation inside a gilded cage. Sue hears Ora's singing inside her head, befriends her via telephone and hopes to meet her one day. Events in the book unfold in a reverse chronology, as the first chapter takes place after Ora's death and proceeds backwards in time. CLAMP manages to present a richly detailed retro-mechanical future using a minimum number of panels per page; reading this book is like looking into a dystopic future through one tiny, perfectly square frame, as the story unfolds across nearly blank pages scattered with repeating love song lyrics. The character designs are magnificent and tiny details on the clockwork birds and imaginative effects are stunning. Though CLAMP's most experimental work, it's still accessible to a wide audience. <i>(June)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Penniless, exiled in London, estranged from relations, and on the run from most of the police forces of Europe, his ambitions as a revolutionary were frequently thwarted, and his major writings on politics and economics remained unpublished (in some cases until after the Second World War). He has not lacked biographers, but even the most distinguished have been more interested in the evolution of his ideas than any other aspect of his life. Francis Wheen's fresh, lively, and moving biography of Marx considers the whole man--brain, beard, and the rest of his body. Unencumbered by ideological point scoring, this is a very readable, humorous, and sympathetic account. Wheen has an ear for juicy gossip and an eye for original detail. Marx comes across as a hell-raising bohemian, an intellectual bully, and a perceptive critic of capitalist chaos, but also a family man of Victorian conformity (personally vetting his daughters' suitors), Victorian ailments (carbuncles above all), and Victorian weaknesses (notably alcohol, tobacco, and, on occasion, his housekeeper). But there is great pathos, too, as Marx witnessed the deaths of four of his six children. For those readers who feel Marxism has given Marx a bad name, this is a rewarding and enlightening book. <i>--Miles Taylor, Amazon.co.uk</i>Francis Wheen is a distinguished author and journalist who was voted Columnist of the Year in February 1997 for his weekly column in the Guardian. He has written several books including the highly acclaimed biography of Tom Driberg MP, which was shortlisted for the Whitbread prize.</p><h2>The Healing Path</h2><p>This is a uniquely accessible fabulously illustrated color guide to both the theory and practice of Eastern healing traditions.</p><p>Converts and skeptics alike will admire Young's balanced, accessible study of Eastern medical traditions. More comparative anthropology than health guide, it will be ideal for people interested in Eastern medicines but daunted by the information glut. Young (Acupressure Step by Step), who has extensive and intensive training (five years in Japan studying acupuncture, herbal medicine, massage, movement therapy and so on; advanced acupuncture and qi gong training in China; numerous visits to India to study Tibetan and Ayurvedic medicine) advocates an informed selectivity (i.e., pick and choose from among these practices), which avoids blurring the traditions into the kind of exotic pan-Asian fantasy promoted by some Westerners. Each country is presented distinctly, as are their unique traditions. Concise historical contexts offer some fascinating tidbits. For example, after observing Indian doctors performing nose reconstructive surgery in the 18th century, British surgeons introduced the practice to Europe. By necessity, Young's far-ranging overview details only a few specifics, like Tibetan yoga, and mentions numerous others with refreshing and striking matter-of-factness. The layout is both artistic, featuring abundant reprints of Tibetan mandalas or sacred Japanese talismans, and instructive, with images of Japanese bathers in natural hot springs and photographs of stretching, massage and other techniques. This graceful treatment will please practitioners and help newcomers decide where to begin, and the book's selection by the One Spirit Book Club will bring added attention. <p></p><p>Copyright 2001 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p></p><h2>The Atlas of The Human Body</h2><p>Comprehensive reference for student and general reader</p><p></p><h2>C-Mass Calisthenics Mass: How to Maximize Muscle Growth Using Bodyweight-Only Training</h2><p>Is it really possible to add significant extra muscle-bulk to your frame using bodyweight exercise only?

Rooted in a tale Kimber heard while exploring the Atlantic seaboard, Mr. Anderson is the novelist&#x2019;s transatlantic tale of slavery, Indian relations, and frontier life. Having been kidnapped in England, transported across the Middle Passage, and sold to a brutal Maryland planter as a white slave, Tom Anderson gains his freedom and in rapid succession becomes a successful trader, a war hero, and a friend to slave, Indian, Quebecois, and Englishman alike. Still engaging 250 years after its original publication, Mr. Anderson offers a rich and varied portrayal of the mid-eighteenth-century Atlantic world. </p> <p> This Broadview edition features an introduction by both a literary scholar and a historian, elaborating on significant themes in the novel. The appendices include an extensive selection of documents&#x2015;some unpublished elsewhere&#x2015;further contextualizing many of those themes, including slavery, British representations of colonial America, and eighteenth-century British literature&#x2019;s emphasis on sensibility and the &#x201c;cult of feeling.&#x201d; </p></p><p><p> <strong>Matthew Mason</strong> and <strong>Nicholas Mason</strong> are Assistant Professor of History and Associate Professor of English, respectively, at Brigham Young University. </p><p> &#x201c;In the early 1750s Edward Kimber completed <em>The History of the Life and Adventures of Mr. Anderson</em>, a strange and wonderful novel that quickly disappeared without a trace. The problem was not a boring narrative. He spun a complex tale of two young lovers in Maryland who tried to defy the conventions of a patriarchal Atlantic world of the eighteenth century. Rather, the problem was that Kimber dealt openly with economic oppression and human exploitation, imagining a violent slave revolt against the great planters of Virginia. One has to be reminded constantly that this work appeared many years before Abolitionists in England and America effectively challenged bondage. This book provides a splendid introduction to the violent complexity of Atlantic history.&#x201d; &#x2015; T.H. Breen, Northwestern University </p> <p> &#x201c;<em>The History of the Life and Adventures of Mr. Anderson</em> presents a fascinating glimpse into English perceptions of North America in the mid-eighteenth century. As Matthew and Nicholas Mason point out in their astute and accessible introduction, Edward Kimber&#x2019;s long-forgotten novel also reminds us that the eighteenth-century novel emerged in the transatlantic sphere. The appendices richly situate the novel in the context of other British writings on North America, including Kimber&#x2019;s own (he traveled in the colonies from 1742 to 1744, and mined these experiences repeatedly in his long and productive career). Both the appendices and the Masons&#x2019; introduction are particularly good in providing contexts for understanding Kimber&#x2019;s complex representations of indentured servitude and chattel slavery in the American colonies.&#x201d; &#x2015; Melissa Homestead, University of Nebraska Lincoln </p></p><h2>The Body in the Castle Well (A Bruno, Chief of Police Novel)</h2><p><p><em>New York Times Bestselling Author</em>An aging art scholar and a visiting student, haunting echoes of Frances colonialist past, and a delicious navarin of lamb Bruno is back, and his latest case leads him from the Renaissance to the French Resistance and beyond by way of a corpse at the bottom of a well.</p></p><p>MARTIN WALKER is a senior fellow of the Global Business Policy Council, a private think tank based in Washington, D.C.

It is not an instructional manual on how to escape from a batterer. Plenty of these exist. It is a travel guide to a country no one visits willingly, the collective tales of past travelers making the landscape less threatening, less alien. I hope the many voices in this book will convince you that these stories belong to all of us. Domestic abuse doesn&#39;t just happen &#34;out there&#34; somewhere--it happens in our town, in our neighborhood, on our street. It happens to people we see at the supermarket, the movie theater, the ballet, the bowling alley, and the PTA board meeting. It happens to our friends, our coworkers, and our family members. Women who have experienced domestic abuse look just like everyone else. They look just like me. Abused women look just like Judy North, a first-grade teacher from Nebraska who remained with her abusive husband for ten years, until the night she finally stood up to him...and woke up in the emergency room. Abused women look just like Whitney Benson, a Mormon college student from southern Utah. She worries about the scars on her face from her boyfriend&#39;s class ring; I worry about the scars on her soul from his carefully crafted campaign of criticism, intimidation, and punishing rape. And abused women look just like Andrea Hartley, a pediatrician in her late forties who considers herself extremely fortunate. Although the man she married when she was thirty proved to be extremely violent, the emotional support of her family, friends, and medical colleagues enabled her to leave him only four months later. They come from all walks of life. Some are well educated; others barely finished high school. Some come from wealthy families; others come from poor ones. Some witnessed terrifying family violence as children; others never heard an angry word. Some were raised by warm, supportive families; others by cold, distant families. Some married young; others married late. They worship in churches, in synagogues, or not at all. They come from big cities, small towns, farming communities, and suburbs. What these women have in common is that each was in an intimate relationship with a man who abused her. Some were abused physically. Some were abused sexually. All were abused psychologically...the most devastating type of abuse, leaving the deepest wounds. This is not a book about guns, knives, emergency rooms, or police reports. Many stories focus instead on the subtle campaign of abuse, wearying and corrosive, which trapped their teller in a web of daily threat. Yet despite the humiliation, fear, and isolation, each woman managed to escape from her abuser. Theirs are stories, not of frailty, but of clarity, resourcefulness, and strength.</p><p>It is with pride that Volcano Press is publishing Elaine Weiss. Her books demonstrate the great advances in the struggle against family violence that have taken place since we first published BATTERED WIVES in the early 1970s. <p>In those early days, a handful of feminists, scattered across the United States, were creating shelters for battered women--without funding, without community understanding, against great odds. It was and still is a historic movement. </p><p>Today, we have the Violence Against Women Act (VAWA), which established an agency of the U.S. Department of Justice. In addition, there are many state domestic violence coalitions and a myriad of local and national programs to support battered women. </p><p>And, as author Elaine Weiss says, "Most abused women are not passive victims. They show enormous strength, both while they are within the relationship, and as they work to extricate themselves. One proof of this strength is the huge number who ultimately manage to break free and go on with their lives. They do not wait to be rescued. They rescue themselves. They are resourceful. They fight back. They take care of themselves, and often of their children." </p><p>We thank Elaine for giving voices to these women. </p><p>Ruth Gottstein, Publisher <br>Adam Gottstein, Associate Publisher <br>Volcano Press</p>This is not a reference text about domestic violence. It is not an instructional manual on how to escape from a batterer. Plenty of these exist. It is a travel guide to a country no one visits willingly, the collective tales of past travelers making the landscape less threatening, less alien. People have always counted on stories to make sense of their lives. In 1997, I set out to gather a particular set of stories. I traveled across the country interviewing women who were once in an abusive relationship, who left their abuser, and who went on to reconstruct their lives. It was far too easy for me to find these women. I met them everywhere: on airplanes, at conferences, in community board meetings, at religious services, in offices, schools, and hospitals. Their stories were difficult to hear. Ultimately, though, the pain of the stories was balanced by the humor, insight, and remarkable courage of the women who shared them with me.</p><h2>Ranma 1/2, Vol. 10</h2><p>Follows the adventures of half-boy, half-girl martial artist Ranma, whose transforming gender problems began at the Accursed Springs in China when he became cursed to turn into a girl when splashed with cold water, and back into a boy with hot water.</p><p>The spotlight on Rumiko Takahashi's career began in 1978 when she won an honorable mention in Shogakukan's annual New Comic Artist Contest for Those Selfish Aliens. Later that same year, her boy-meets-alien comedy series, Urusei Yatsura, was serialized in Weekly Shonen Sunday. This phenomenally successful manga series was adapted into anime format and spawned a TV series and half a dozen theatrical-release movies, all incredibly popular in their own right.

With him was a team of underwater explorers that included the artist Ken Marschall, the historian Don Lynch, and two actors from the movie, Bill Paxton and Lewis Abernathy (who played Brock Lovett and Lewis Bodine). Their equipment included state-of-the-art digital 3D cameras, a pair of Remotely Operated Vehicles (ROVs), and a specially built deep-water lighting platform that illuminated the fabled ship as never before. In a series of historic dives they filmed deep inside the ghostly liner, obtaining haunting, never-before-seen images.In spring 2003, this remarkable journey into the heart of the Titanic will be presented coast-to-coast in a digital 3D giant screen film, Ghosts of the Abyss. For those who will be drawn anew to the story of the Titanic, as well as for those who have never stopped being fascinated by the ship&#39;s tragic fate, James Cameron&#39;s &#34;Ghosts of the Abyss&#34; will be a revelation in pictures and words. Cameron compellingly describes just what keeps him returning to the Titanic, and the meticulous journals kept during the dives form a dramatic adventure narrative. But what will truly astonish are new, incredibly vivid images from within the ship&#39;s staterooms and public rooms, matched with archival images from 1912 and new paintings and diagrams-a &#34;then-and-now gallery&#34; that captures as never before the history, the drama, and the legend of the Titanic.</p><p><b>Don Lynch</b> is the historian of the Titanic Historical Society and an authority on the ship's passengers and crew. James Cameron credits his book <i>Titanic: An Illustrated History</i> (with paintings by Ken Marschall) as a primary inspiration for the movie Titanic. He lives in Los Angeles. <b>Ken Marschall</b>, the world's leading Titanic artist and an acknowledged expert on the ship, created the celebrated images for Dr. Robert D. Ballard's best-selling The Discovery of the Titanic. He lives in Redondo Beach, California. <b>James Cameron</b>, in addition to being one of Hollywood's foremost movie directors, now has logged more time exploring the wreck of the Titanic than anyone else-220 hours, more than Captain Edward J. Smith of the Titanic spent aboard the ship.The Titanic looks like, well, a wreck in this lavishly illustrated coffee-table companion to Titanic director Cameron's 3-D undersea documentary. Titanic historian Lynch and artist and Titanic buff Marschall recap the story of the ship's doomed maiden voyage, describe the technology and logistics of undersea film-making, and ponder the parallels between the Titanic tragedy and the 9/11 attacks, which occurred during filming ("both events were met with outrage and disbelief-and the tragedies would remain indelibly etched on the collective memory of the world"). But the book's raison d'etre are the photos, and here it runs up against the fact that, unlike architectural ruins, nautical ruins are not very picturesque. Cameron's sonar imaging, lighting rigs and robot cameras yield not much more than visually similar images of gloom and rot, rendered in the deep-sea palette of blue-green and rust washed out by the glare of submarine floodlights. The authors juxtapose archival images of the ship's Edwardian luxury decor and furnishings with photos of their waterlogged remains, and it is here-and in the viewer's imagination-that the pictures become haunting. <br>Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Mighty Mac Tsl 37 (Thomas Story Library)</h2><p>THIS IS BRAND NEW BOOK.WE PROVIDE 100% CUSTOMER SATISFACTION.</p><p></p><h2>Selections from The Art of Party Crashing in Medieval Iraq</h2><p>He&#x2019;s fond of anyone who throws a party;<br>he&#x2019;s always at a party in his dreams,<br>for party-crashing&#x2019;s blazoned on his heart . . .<br>a prisoner to the path of fi ne cuisine.<br><br>With this statement, al-Khatib al-Baghdadi, a Muslim preacher and scholar, introduces The Art of Party-Crashing, a book that represents a sharp departure from the religious scholarship for which he is known.

Since her first SF novels were published in the 1940s, her adventure SF has enthralled readers young and old. With series such as<i> Time Traders, Solar Queen, Forerunner, Beast Master, Crosstime, </i>and <i>Janus</i>, as well as many stand-alone novels, her tales of action and adventure throughout the galaxy have drawn countless readers to science fiction. <br><br>Her fantasy, including the best-selling <i>Witch World</i> series, her "Magic" series, and many other unrelated novels, has been popular with readers for decades. Lauded as a Grand Master by the Science Fiction Writers of America, she is the recipient of a Life Achievement Award from the World Fantasy Convention. Not only have her books been enormously popular; she also has inspired several generations of SF and fantasy writers, especially many talented women writers who have followed in her footsteps. In the past two decades she has worked with other writers on a number of novels. Most notable among these are collaborations with Mercedes Lackey, the <i>Halfblood Chronicles,</i> as well as collaborations with A.C. Crispin (in the <i>Witch World</i> series) and Sherwood Smith (in the <i>Time Traders </i>and <i>Solar Queen </i>series).

The other colorful, clearly told stories include Wilanne Belden's moving account of a strange child's survival in war and wilderness, Charles de Lint's tale of a wondrous white road, Ardath Mayhar's narrative of a young boy coming to terms with his "witch borne" powers and Elizabeth Scarborough's fable of a warrior meeting a new challenge: a baby needing a foster mother.

His many books include The Mammoth Book of True Crime and A Plague of Murder. Damon Wilson is author of several books, most notably The Mammoth Book of Nostradamus.The prolific Wilson (A Criminal History of Mankind, et al.) offers this compilation of true crime narratives, abbreviated accounts of both famous and lesser-known cases. "Murder interests me," Wilson writes, "because it is the most extreme form of the denial of this human potentiality. Life devaluation has become a commonplace of our century." Wilson analyzes numerous crimes and their perpetrators, ranging from lady-killers to manic messiahs, contemporary and past: " . . . to kill by poison is perhaps the most childish of all criminal acts . . . . Nearly all the famous poisoners have been rather childish personalitiesoften delightful and charming, but fundamentally children determined to get their own way by stealth." In the "Motiveless Murder" chapter, he once again expounds on the importance of science-fiction author A. E. Van Vogt's "right man" theoryviolent men who treat women as slavesas "one of the most important breakthroughs since Sigmund Freud 'discovered' the unconscious." Wilson's now-familiar practice of intertwining throughout a rich array of literary references (Ray Bradbury, James Thurber, James Jones, etc.) only adds to the informed tone of this massive survey, so extensive and worthy a reference that some repetition is not an annoyance. An introduction defines the links between Wilson's fiction and nonfiction. <br>Copyright 1988 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Selected Essays (Penguin Classics)</h2><p>This volume contains a generous selection from the essays Johnson published twice weekly as "The Rambler" in the early 1750s.

Vienna, 1934. Ten-year-old cello prodigy Meret Voytek becomes a pupil of concert pianist Viktor Rosen, a Jew in exile from Germany. The Isle of Man, 1940. An interned Hungarian physicist is recruited for the Manhattan Project in Los Alomos, building the atom bomb for the Americans. Auschwitz, 1944. Meret is imprisoned but is saved from certain death to play the cello in the camp orchestra. She is playing for her life. London, 1948. Viktor Rosen wants to relinquish his Communist Party membership after thirty years. His comrade and friend reminds him that he committed for life... These seemingly unconnected strands all collide forcefully with a brazen murder on a London Underground platform, revealing an intricate web of secrecy and deception which Detective Frederick Troy must untangle.</p><p>John Lawton worked for Channel 4 for many years, and, among many others, produced Harold Pinter&#39;s &#39;O Superman&#39;, the least-watched most-argued-over programme of the 90s. He has written seven novels in his Troy series, two Joe Wilderness novels, the standalone Sweet Sunday, a couple of short stories and the occasional essay. He writes very slowly and almost entirely on the hoof in the USA or Italy, but professes to be a resident of a tiny village in the Derbyshire Peak District. He admires the work of Barbara Gowdy, TC Boyle, Oliver Bleeck, Franz Schubert and Clara Schumann - and is passionate about the playing of Maria Joao Pires. He has no known hobbies, belongs to no organisations and hates being photographed.*Starred Review* Lawton&#x2019;s fifth Inspector Freddie Troy novel, starring the aristocratic Scotland Yard copper, is the best yet in a consistently strong series. Lawton has always pushed the boundaries of the series crime novel, edging ever closer to broad-canvas historical fiction, but this time he has leaped the fence altogether. Like Dennis Lehane in The Given Day (2008), Lawton introduces multiple characters and stories in a sweeping tale that comes together at a particular historical moment, but unlike Lehane, he does all that without abandoning his series hero or the continuity established in the previous volumes. Drawing on the events chronicled in his earlier novels, especially Second Violin (2008), set during WWII, Lawton moves seamlessly from Vienna in 1934, where we meet 10-year-old cello prodigy Meret Voytek and her teacher, renowned musician Viktor Rosen, to London in 1948, with stops along the way at Auschwitz and Los Alamos. Voytek and Rosen are reunited in London, where they meet Inspector Troy, himself an aspiring pianist, and become persons of interest in a murder investigation. Yes, in the end this is a cold war spy novel, but if postwar London&#x2014;the world of Philby and Burgess, of perpetual shortages and rationing in a grayed-out country &#x201c;sadly in need of a metaphoric, symbolic coat of paint&#x201d;&#x2014;is the historical spot on the map in which the story reaches its climax, it is but one of many interconnected points in time and space that form the rich fabric of a truly multitextured tale. --Bill Ott</p><h2>The Texas Connection</h2><p>A look at yet another Kennedy assassination conspiracy theory uses conversations and written correspondence to argue that Lyndon Johnson may have helped plan the assassination.

In 1943 she entered a sanatorium for morphine addiction where she died a mysterious death while under the care of Nazis doctors.<br></p><p><i>Priestess of Morphine: The Lost Writings of Marie-Madeleine</i> contains many of this fascinating woman's works, translated for the first time into English, and also contains Stephen J. Gertz's Foreword explaining why Marie-Madeleine has become a rediscovered heroine of lesbian and drug literature. Fascinating images from Marie-Madeleine's lost literature and career supplement this volume. <br></p><p>Editor Ronald K.

In her time, under the name of Marie Madeleine, she established a name for herself as a writer of unusually lyrical, stunningly sensual, shockingly erotic and hotly passionate poetry and prose. She enjoyed immense popularity during her lifetime, and her books were published in the thousands. But because she was considered a degenerate by the Nazis, most of them were destroyed. Despite the obvious threat to her work and even her personal safety, she continued writing in defiance of the Nazi mores.<br><br><b> Ronald K.

And as Billy Bob's grandfather once told him, you do well in life by keeping the roots in a clear stream and not letting anyone taint the water for you. But in Holland's dusty little hometown of Deaf Smith, in the hill country north of Austin, local kingpin Earl Deitrich has made a fortune running roughshod and tainting anyone who stands in his way. Billy Bob has problems with Deitrich and his shamelessly callous demeanor, but can't shake the legacy of his passion for Deitrich's "heartbreak-beautiful" wife, Peggy Jean.<br><br>When Holland takes on the defense of Wilbur Pickett--a man accused of stealing an heirloom and three hundred thousand dollars in bonds from Deitrich's office--he finds himself up against not only Earl's power and influence, but also a past Billy Bob can't will away.&nbsp;&nbsp;A wonderfully realized novel, rich in Texas atmosphere and lore, and a dazzling portrait of the deadly consequences of self-delusion, <b>Heartwood</b> could only have been written by James Lee Burke, a writer in expert command of his craft.</p><p>Actor Will Patton gives a quirky performance in James Lee Burke's intricately layered story. Following his earlier novel, <i>Cimarron Rose</i>, Burke returns to Deaf Smith, Texas, offering his reluctant hero, defense attorney Billy Bob Holland, another shot at redemption. Representing a local loser caught in a web of lies, Holland faces Earl Dietrich, an unwelcome newcomer whose money, influence, and condescending attitude rub the lawyer against the grain: "There was nothing directly aggressive about Earl, but his conversation always had to do with himself, or what he owned." Patton narrates wonderfully, using the slow scratch of his voice and expert pacing to unravel Burke's modern-day mystery. Accentuated with musical transitions and subtle sound effects, the excellent narration and evocative writing render <i>Heartwood</i> an intriguing and enjoyable listen. (Running time: 5 hours, 4 cassettes) <i>--George Laney</i>Peggy Jean Deitrich smells of heat and roses, volunteers in the local library, and hides her bruises well. Once Billy Bob Holland made love to her in the woods above the river. Now Peggy Jean is married to the richest man in town. And Billy Bob, a former Texas Ranger who now defends criminals for a living, is out to destroy him.<p>Earl Deitrich has had his way with the town of Deaf Smith for years. Then Earl accused a hapless roustabout of a crime, and touched off a chain reaction of murder from the streets of Houston to the hill country around Billy Bob's ranch. Fueled by his memories and regrets, following a trail of shattered lives, Billy Bob knows that he must go after Earl with a vengeance. He just doesn't know how many people will get in the way -- or who will be the last to die....</p></p><h2>The Wonder of Being: Awakening to an Intimacy Beyond Words</h2><p>A combined and fully revised edition of Jeff Foster's first two books <i>Life Without a Centre</i> and <i>Beyond Awakening</i>.<br><br> What if life is infinitely <i>simpler</i> than you ever imagined?<br><br> We spend our lives seeking wealth, success, love, fulfilment, and even "spiritual enlightenment" in the future. Yet right at the heart of life there is an intimacy, a simplicity, a wholeness that is totally beyond words&#x2014;and which cannot be reached through any kind of effort. In our attempts to change, to improve ourselves, or become "enlightened," we end up ignoring this wordless intimacy which is our birthright and our true home.<br><br><i>The Wonder of Being</i> points to the eternal freedom which exists beyond the seeker and the sought, and shows us the hidden assumptions that underlie our seeking activities.

The crushing British defeat prompted France to recognize the American colonies as an independent nation, declare war on England, and commit money, ships, arms, and men to the rebellion. John Luzader&#39;s impressive Saratoga: A Military History of the Decisive Campaign of the American Revolution is the first all-encompassing objective account of these pivotal months in American history.</p><p>A veteran of World War II and graduate of West Virginia University and the University of Texas, John Luzader worked for the U.S. Department of Defense as a research historian.

Chosen as one of the best travel books of 1996 by the <i>New York Times Book Review</i>.<br></p><p>British born author Simon Winchester lived in Hong Kong before setting off on a journey up the Chang Jiang or Yangtze River as it is most often referred to in the West. In <b>The River at the Center of the World: A Journey Up the Yangtze and Back in Chinese Time</b>, he chronicles his adventures across China along the 3,964-mile River. Employing nearly every mode of transportation--including boat, train, jeep and shoe leather--Winchester recalls his passionate exploration of the countryside, while providing important and engaging historical information. His recollections of the Chinese people are often less complimentary, as he exudes an air of disgust at the country's apparent disregard for pollution, its awkward modern architecture and decaying historical monuments.It is the symbolic heart of China. Rising in the mountains of the Tibetan border, it pierces 3,900 miles of rugged country before debouching into the oily swells of the East China Sea. Its path embraces every geographic feature and almost every ethnic group, and its banks are home to both scenic splendor and foul industrial pollution. Connecting China&#39;s heartland cities with that volatile coastal giant Shanghai, it has also historically connected China to the outside world through its nearly one thousand miles of navigable waters. And to travel up those waters is to travel back in history, to sense the soul of China. Long off-limits to foreigners, the far reaches of the Yangtze are still off-limits to most tourists and travelers simply by dint of the difficulty in traversing the terrain. But, for Simon Winchester, traveling the length of this mighty river was a lifelong dream and, together with a Chinese companion, he set out to do just that. The result is this unforgettable portrait of China. Endlessly curious, urbane, witty, and knowledgeable, Winchester introduces us to a world we might otherwise have missed. To follow him on his adventures up the Yangtze is to experience the essence of China - to absorb its flavors as well as learn its history and politics, to feel its geography and climate as well as engage in its culture, and to meet up en route with uncommon people in remote and almost inaccessible places. This is travel writing at its best: lively and informative, amusing and thoroughly engaging.</p><h2>The Spanish Bride</h2><p>This &#34;true&#34; story of Juana and Henry Smith seems unbelievable. But truth is stranger than fiction. I&#39;ve read a great deal of General Smith&#39;s biography and though Heyer certainy took liberties, the worst that can be said is that she toned down his (and other men&#39;s) adoration of his wife. This tale is singular in that in our cynical age it gives voice to a very real voice of love and adoration in an age we almost believe to be a myth. Yes, it is battle heavy and if you have no interest in the Napoleanic Wars, you may become bored. But if you want to learn a great deal of the history of the period in an entertaining way, you can look to no better source. The scene at Waterloo is unforgettable.</p><p></p><h2>Four Letter Word: Original Love Letters</h2><p>An inspired collection of new fiction from some of today&#x2019;s most celebrated writers, exploring the charm, potency and seductive powers of a classic genre . . . the love letter.<br><br>When did you last receive a love letter? Have emails and text messages taken over from this romantic form of communication? Would a love letter by a novelist or poet be better than one written by you or me? How would the literary traits of a writer shape the love letters he or she writes? And might a love letter tell us something about its author their other writing could not?<br><br>Editors Joshua Knelman and Rosalind Porter have assembled an exciting and unique collection of new fiction: they&#x2019;ve asked some of our most celebrated contemporary writers to explore the distinctive form of the love letter to remind us how enticing words can be and perhaps even to resurrect a dying custom. Each of the pieces in this anthology is radically different from the others, each is a testimony to the creative powers of our leading writers today, and each is guaranteed to seduce.<br><br><b>Four Letter Word </b>brings us work from 35 of today&#x2019;s best writers, including Margaret Atwood, Miriam Toews, David Bezmozgis, Douglas Coupland, Michel Faber, A.L.

She lives in London.<b>Introduction</b><br><br>On 4 May 2000, I was one of millions of people to open an email with the subject &#x2018;I Love You&#x2019; containing an attachment &#x2018;Love Letter For You&#x2019;. Launched by a Filipino hacker, the love letter virus &#x2018;Love Bug&#x2019; first appeared in Hong Kong before quickly spreading to Europe and then to the United States, infecting servers and costing companies an estimated one billion dollars in lost time and recovery. <br><br>In the UK, both the House of Commons and House of Lords were hit, leading to a shutdown of email that lasted a few hours. &#x2018;The message was noticed before lunch. It was a message sending love to you, which is the sort of message a lot of us here don&#x2019;t expect to be receiving,&#x2019; claimed the deputy sergeant at arms for the House of Commons at the time. Which begs the question: who are the people who would expect to receive such a message? <br><br>Most of us don&#x2019;t check the post in anticipation of scented envelopes stuffed with locks of hair, though many of us have received a fervent card; a flirtatious email; a suggestive text. Often we save them and reread them to remember a moment in time or a phase of life, even those from relationships long dead.<br><br>Over time, a hierarchy to this kind of semantic courting has developed with the ambiguous text at the bottom and the email only a bit higher up. A card may prove a touching example of someone willing to take the time to find a stamp, seek out an address and locate a post-box, but the letter &#x2014; with all the noble attributes of the card and no space restrictions &#x2014; is perhaps the supreme medium to befit a message of love. Also, it harks back to a chivalrous age full of men attaching scrolls to pigeons or throwing bottles into the sea and aligns the writer of the love letter with a whole tradition of literary seduction. <br><br>Written on something highly flammable and sent pre�cari�ously by post or slipped underneath a door, there has always been something slightly risky about the love letter. Someone delivering it to the wrong person who then got the wrong idea; letters getting lost and therefore never replied to. <br><br>&#x2018;How is it that I have just received your seventh letter,&#x2019; writes Denis Diderot to his young mistress Sophie Voland in 1762, &#x2018;when you have only four of the nine I have written you, including this one?&#x2019; It&#x2019;s possible to see how the margin for miscommunication here might become so wide that it, not the declaration of love itself, is in danger of becoming the main subject of their letters. <br><br>Email may have removed the fire hazard, but has its own set of potentially catastrophic contingencies. Any form of writing, it seems, demands that one worry about practicalities. The speed of the post or the Broadband connection has the power to send a lover into a fit of nervous rage when no reply comes and, even worse, the written word can hang around for ever. Long after the flame has been extinguished, those pleas of passion you jotted down might still be in her underwear drawer. And if you suddenly become famous? What&#x2019;s to stop him from selling your letters to the library which bought the rest of your papers?<br><br>The reclusive writer J. D. Salinger took the poet and critic Ian Hamilton to court when Hamilton tried to quote from various letters of Salinger&#x2019;s deposited in libraries and archives. Hamilton argued that since the letters were in the public domain it was only reasonable that he be permitted to repro�duce them. And although he lost his case and had to resort to para�phrase, anyone can look at Salinger&#x2019;s letters in their entirety in the libraries and archives. Nothing, it would seem, is sacred.<br><br>Unlike a phone call or a conversation, a written declaration of love is a thing: a thing which exists in the world (often for a very long time) with the power to conjure up an emotional disposition, which is why, on occasion, we ask for them back, destroy them, prevent people from publishing them or keep them. <br><br>Something that has survived thirteen house moves is a Valentine I was given when I was five. &#x2018;Dear R,&#x2019; it reads (his mother, or possibly our teacher, having written out this bit, though the statement itself is in my enthusiast&#x2019;s own hand). &#x2018;I want to love you. Happy Valentine&#x2019;s Day, From P.&#x2019;<br><br>I adore this card. I remember P well, perhaps because I&#x2019;ve had his Valentine for all these years. Sometimes, when I come across it, I feel the urge to write back &#x2014; I want to clear up the ambiguity, an ambiguity that&#x2019;s intrinsic to most love letters. &#x2018;Dear P, Does this mean you don&#x2019;t love me? That you want to, but can&#x2019;t for some particular reason? Or are you asking my permission to do so and if that&#x2019;s the case, well then yes. Yes. Yes. Yes.&#x2019;<br><br>In addition to this souvenir I have folders con�taining hundreds of pieces of correspondence from friends and family; colleagues and tutors. One folder marked &#x2018;random&#x2019; holds papers from people I&#x2019;ve never been particularly close to. Most of them are birthday cards but there are also a few love letters (some of which are intentionally anonymous).<br>Significant members of my family, good friends and exes all have personalised folders, as do people who fall under the general heading of &#x2018;flirtations&#x2019; since I somehow feel it&#x2019;s worth keeping the artefacts of relationships that never quite happened. Why I&#x2019;ve been hauling around every expression of even the most vestigial of feelings says something about how sentimental I am but also about how, in this speed-dating age, traditional modes of courtship still have value.<br><br>The reasons for keeping bits and pieces from relationships that did happen are more straightforward. Without the pile of junk in A&#x2019;s folder, I&#x2019;m sure I would have forgotten, in lieu of more impressionistic memories, that he sent me a postcard every day (the same postcard, in fact), for a month after we first met.<br><br>&#x2018;This is the third,&#x2019; he wrote, &#x2018;in what is fast becoming a series of postcards.&#x2019; A few days later, after I&#x2019;d gone away on holiday, &#x2018;It was GREAT to speak to you last night. I have to admit to missing you, especially when I&#x2019;m walking down the street&#x2019; (?). Later still, &#x2018;I have taken to crossing my fingers in order to simulate your presence&#x2019; (??) and, finally, &#x2018;I guess it&#x2019;s pretty obvious that I miss you . . . Right now I feel emotionally dead.&#x2019;<br><br>Since I don&#x2019;t have copies of what I wrote back, appreciating these postcards involves an imaginative reconstruction of the early days of our relationship. What was it about walking down the street with me that had been so bloody great? What I do remember is falling for this person not when I first met him, but soon after the postcards began to arrive.<br>&#x2018;Dear R,&#x2019; reads a card encased in a large envelope. &#x2018;Wishing you a very happy birthday, Love G.&#x2019; In the envelope is a disc containing every email G and I exchanged &#x2014; something deemed fit for a birthday present long after we&#x2019;d split up. We wanted, it would seem, evidence certifying that those halcyon, dating days really had existed, but they also &#x2014; quite unintentionally &#x2014; serve as a reminder of the quotidian reality that followed as the infatuation stage wore off, expressed through angry emails and unquestionably dull ones too. &#x2018;Here is F&#x2019;s address,&#x2019; reads one. An email containing nothing except a link to a website that does currency exchanges (even though we never went anywhere together) is another.<br><br>The folder to which I&#x2019;ve returned most often is a wad of printed-out emails, postcards and bone fida love letters from L, with whom I had an on-again, off-again relationship.<br><br>&#x2018;Dear R. It was lovely to meet you last night.&#x2019; Then a very long, very charming preamble, ending with, &#x2018;It&#x2019;s coming up to the anniversary of our having known each other for forty-eight hours. How to celebrate?&#x2019;<br><br>Even during our &#x2018;off&#x2019; phases, every letter from L was filed away neatly &#x2014; every email printed out &#x2014; because somehow I&#x2019;d known that a material record of our written communication would be of value to me. I&#x2019;ve often returned to L&#x2019;s folder because I sometimes think it holds clues as to why so many things worked out yet, overall, the whole thing didn&#x2019;t. More than what we said in passing, our letters and emails contain a degree of authenticity about the way we felt because we put some thought into what we meant before setting it down on paper (before beaming it off into cyberspace), offering our words to one another with the awareness that giving them to someone meant forfeiting ownership. <br><br>Like any published writer, the author of the love letter can never take anything back. Words &#x2014; unlike the actual feelings they connote &#x2014; cannot simply be loaned. L was a journalist, well aware of how permanent the written word is and paid to use language to dress up a story in an alluring way. And he was good. They never failed, these letters, to lift me out of some dark mood or stretch of ennui, even if I did suspect a degree of contrivance to them. Because all writing is an affective art form &#x2014; the manifestation of a voice meant to move the reader in a premeditated way &#x2014; which is why love letters can be so exhilarating and so convincing; which is why so many people opened the &#x2018;Love Bug&#x2019; email.<br><br>Even though he got caught, the Filipino hacker was no dummy. He observed our collective hunger for a demonstration of something so ethereal it&#x2019;s not always possible to demonstrate it, and with prescience, he lured us to him with a false promise of words. Because with words, anything is possible. Through words, even our most ardent desires can be fulfilled. <br><br>Over the past year, Joshua Knelman and I asked some of our most esteemed writers to a...</p><h2>Analytical Exposition of the Epistle of Paul to the Romans</h2><p>From the first chapter: &#34;The epistle of the Romans is the nearest approach of anything in the inspired volume to a systematic view of Christianity.

Sample topics include gratitude, harmony, self-nurturing, positive body image, the importance of scented linen closets, and many others. Each essay sports a pithy quote from (surprise!) the likes of Kahlil Gibran. Viewed uncritically, it's hard to argue with <i>Simple Abundance</i>'s earnest admonitions to appreciate life, in all its messy imperfect excellence. And the fact that serenity and happiness are each in dreadfully short supply can excuse some of the treacly writing. But Breathnach sometimes lapses into what can only be described as her "Martha Stewart on Prozac" voice, and the results are aggravating to the extreme: "If you've been hesitant to strike up a reciprocal relationship with your guardian angel, don't be." Fans of guardian angels will greet these feel-good essays every morning with the rising sun, a cup of mint tea, and a bluebird chirping on the windowsill, and be happy. Skeptics will prefer their coffee very black.Sarah Ban Breathnach is the founder of the Simple Abundance Charitable Trust, a nonprofit bridge group between charitable causes and the public, dedicated to increasing awareness that &#39;doing good&#39; and &#39;living the good life&#39; are soul mates.

Unlike Washington, Mason has been virtually forgotton by history. But this new biography of forgotten patriot George Mason makes a convincing case that Mason belongs in the pantheon of honored Founding Fathers. Trained in the law, Mason was also a farmer, philosopher, botanist, and musician. He was one of the architects of the Declaration of Independence, an author of the Bill of Rights, and one of the strongest proponents of religious liberty in American history. In fact, both Thomas Jefferson and James Madison may have been given undue credit for George Mason's own contributions to American democracy.<br> <br>&nbsp;<br> <br>&nbsp;</p><p>William G.

Williams, was awarded the 1987 National Book Critics Circle Award for Poetry. Reviewing it in <i>The New York Times Book Review</i>, Edward Hirsch noted that the book's compression and exactitude gave it "the feeling of a contemporary sonnet sequence." Hirsch added: "Like Berryman's <i>Dream Songs</i> or Lowell's <i>Notebooks</i>, Mr. Williams's short poems are shapely yet open-minded and self-generative, loosely improvisational though with an underlying formal necesity."</p><p>Since With Ignorance ( LJ 6/15/77) , Williams has been honing a distinct, visually recognizable style that stretches the lines of his verse from margin to margina style not necessarily suited to standard book format. In this newest collection, consisting of 130 8-line stanzas, these long, breathy lines make his poems lean toward a prosy, conversational voice: "After a string of failed romances and intensely remarked sexual adven-/ tures she'd finally married." But Williams is also capable of the strong, lyrical moment, as in his moving elegy to friend and fellow poet Paul Zweig: "Scents of dawn, the softening all-night fire, char, ash, warm ember in the/ early morning chill./ The moment holds, you move across the path and go, the light lifts, breaks:/ goodbye, my friend, farewell." A good choice for contemporary poetry collections. Thom Tammaro, Multidisciplinary Studies Dept., Moorhead State Univ., Minn.<br>Copyright 1987 Reed Business Information, Inc."To put it simply, C. K. Williams is a wonderful poet, in the authentic American tradition of Walt Whitman and W. C. Williams, who tells us on every page what it means to be alive in our time. Among the treasures [in <i>Flesh and Blood</i>] is his sequence of poems on the death of his friend, the poet Paul Zweig. It is unmistakably one of the truly great modern elegies."--Stanley Kunitz<br><br>"A refreshingly urban book. . . . There is a restless intelligence behind all of C. K. Williams's work. . . . The range of his concerns and the depth of his emotional insight give [this book] value. Williams's poems, whatever their shape, remind us how much other poets leave out."--Don Bogen, <i>The Nation</i></p><h2>The Everything Enneagram Book: Identify Your Type, Gain Insight into Your Personality and Find Success in Life, Love, and Business</h2><p>Each of us wears our personality like a disguise-but with the Enneagram, you can strip away that mask, and reveal your true self.

It's not in Spain, or Mexico, and it's not a ski town in the Colorado Rockies, although Durangos do exist in all of those places. This Durango has an industry, albeit a rather odd one-it is a hideout business, a place where people pay to find sanctuary from former friends and associates who are either trying to kill them, or have them killed. Into this Durango comes a former chief justice of a state supreme court, followed by son-in-law Kelly Vines to act as his emissary to the beautiful and savvy mayor. Following them come a false priest, and a run of murders. It takes a Ross Thomas to stir these characters into a witty and ingenious mix readers will not be able to -and certainly would not want to-resist.</p></p><p><p><b>Ross Thomas</b> is ranked as one of the very top thriller writers by his fellow authors, and his readers loudly agree. Two Edgar Awards, and other prizes, only complement the abundant praise that Thomas has received. </p><p>Thomas died in 1995, and since then all but one of his twenty-five novels had gone out of print. This should never have happened to the man of whom <i>The New Yorker</i> has said "Very few...are as consistently entertaining...even fewer can match him for style and power." Minotaur is proud to remedy this situation by reissuing Thomas's novels. So start reading, and prepare to join Ross Thomas's legions of admiring fans.</p>A tiny, godforsaken California town named Durango is the setting for Thomas's ( Out on the Rim ) tense new novel, a suspense story laced with wry wit. The town's mayor, plucky Barbara Huckins, and its chief of police, Sid Fork, are part-time lovers and ex-San Francisco hippies who drifted into Durango 20 years back. The action begins when Jack Adair, an acid-tongued judge falsely accused of taking a big bribe, drops into Durango to hide from whoever wants him silenced. Poor Adair already has a daughter in a mental hospital, a disbarred attorney for a son-in-law and a gay son who committed suicide (or was it murder?). Barbara and Sid, an unlikely duo assisted by no less than four detectives, follow a trail warm with corpses to a brutal killer who dresses up as a priest or a plumber. The socko climax takes place on the Fourth of July, with readers kept in the dark right through the fireworks. In this offbeat diversion, Thomas builds suspense and character almost casually, once again proving himself a master of the crime thriller.

Patriarch Abraham Levy, the proud descendant of fifteen generations of Sephardic Jews, and his wife, the convert Sarah, a monumental, generous woman, illiterate and complex, establish themselves in a village to the west of Jerusalem and become the center of a sprawling, colorful family whose passions, suffering, and unexpected fates partake of both the real and the mythic, not to mention the miraculous.<br>Esau's eponymous narrator is one of a pair of near-sighted Levy twins, who have only a single set of eyeglasses between them. The life choice each boy makes as a result of this childhood experience determines the course of the novel: Jacob, who wears the eyeglasses most of the time, follows his father and becomes the village baker, marrying Leah, fathering children, and shouldering the responsibility of ancestral tradition; while the narrator, with his willfully blurred vision, is cursed and disinherited by his beloved mother and leaves his family and village to become a writer in the United States. After thirty years of exile, he returns home and offers us the brilliant and deeply moving mosaic that is the story of the Levy family.<br>Like his progenitor, Meir Shalev, the narrator finds his portion of the world in books, and the two of them share a Rabelaisian appetite for story and character, an exuberant playfulness, a mischievous sense of irony, and a fascination with the sensuality of childhood, those images, sounds, and odors at the origin of all memory and roots.</p><p>A novel of epic scope and universal themes that chronicles half a century in the life of a family and a nation, from the bestselling Israeli author of <i>The Blue Mountain</i>.Noted Israeli writer Shalev (The Blue Mountain, 1991) takes his time getting nowhere in particular as he tries to put a contemporary spin on the legendary biblical story of a lost inheritance and sibling rivalry. Set in Israel, the story is narrated by Esau, who fled to America when his beloved Leah was wooed and won by twin brother Jacob. Now in his late 50s, Esau is back home visiting his dying father, Abraham Levy, a descendant of illustrious sages but a baker by trade, who had fallen in love and married the splendid red- haired Sarah, daughter of Russian peasant converts who had immigrated to Israel early in the century. Humiliated by the loan her family made after his business was destroyed by an earthquake in 1927, Abraham soon, to Sarah's great sorrow, ignored her. Esau recalls his parents' courtship, his village childhood, his rivalry with Jacob, and the events that led to his flight. He also includes stories of Jacob, who stayed behind with Leah and still works in the bakery. In America, Esau became a food writer, but he never forgot his deep love for Leah or for his mother, though Sarah cursed him when he left home, telling him that ``you won't have family of your own... You won't have wife of your own... You won't have child of your own.'' Which all came to pass. The family history doesn't make the impact it should: Jacob's son is killed in Israel's War of Independence, and Leah, overwhelmed by grief, sleeps the rest of her life away. Though she bears another son, conception and birth do not interrupt her slumber. Nothing is resolved despite pretentious hints, fleshed out by tiresome bits of magic realism (an old aunt has miraculous suckling powers) that promise more. For all its bravado and braggadocio, this novel never quite goes mano a mano with its subject. Arm wrestling without the table. -- <i>Copyright �1994, Kirkus Associates, LP.

John Harrison&#39;s most acclaimed novels in a career of near universal acclaim, CLIMBERS is, perhaps, the least fantastical of his novels. Yet it carries life-changing moments, descriptions of landscape bordering on the hallucinogenic and flights of pure fictive power that leave any notion of the divide between realistic and unrealistic fiction far behind. First published in 1989, CLIMBERS has remained a strong favourite with fans and reviewers alike. A young man seeks to get a grip on his life by taking up rock-climbing. He hopes that by engaging with the hard realities of the rock and the fall he can grasp what is important about life. But as he is drawn into the obsessive world of climbing he learns that taking things to the edge comes with its own price. Retreating from his failed marriage to Pauline, Mike leaves London for the Yorkshire moors, where he meets Normal and his entourage, busy pursuing their own dreams of escape. Travelling from crag to crag throughout the country, they are searching for the unattainable: the perfect climb. Through rock-climbing, Mike discovers an intensity of experience - a wash of pain, fear and excitement - that obliterates the rest of his world. Increasingly addicted to the adrenaline, folklore and camaraderie of the sport, he finds, for a time, a genuine escape. But it is gained at a price... This dark, witty and poetic novel is full of the rugged beauty of nature, of the human drive to test oneself against extremes, and of the elation such escape can bring.</p><p>M. John Harrison was born in the Peak District in 1945 and now lives in London.M. John Harrison has abjured the high-pitched melodramatics of TOUCHING THE VOID for a microscopically observed novel about a group of climbers... descriptions of the various climbs are painstaking and suspenseful, and Harrison has a sharp ear for dialogue. But most impressive is his acute sense of place... the raw beauty of the Pennines. -- Sinclair McKay The Daily Telegraph &#39;Stunning... Harrison makes an intensely poetic and evocative brew of the interstices between sport, passion and obsession. Moments of exquisite surreality rub against others in which you can smell the soil and stone&#39;. The Times</p><h2>Powers of Darkness : Principalities and Powers in Paul&#39;s Letters</h2><p>Satan worship. Witches. New Age channelers. The last two decades have witnessed a vast upsurge in occult activity. Scores of popular books have warned Christians of the dangers and urged them to do battle against these spiritual forces. Few books, however, have developed a careful biblical theology on demons, principalities and powers.

Scores of popular books have warned Christians of the dangers and urged them to do battle against these spiritual forces. Few books, however, have developed a careful biblical theology on demons, principalities and powers.

On a cold winter day, a mouse attends a concert, where her black-and-white world is transformed by the magic of the music. In simple pen-and-ink illustrations, Takao conveys the mouse's emotional experience. As the pianist plays, small spots of color appear. When the music swells, the colors become swirls, enveloping the listeners. As the audience leaves, they take the wonder of the music, now in the form of splashes of color, into their drab world. The central character is moved to capture her feelings of joy by writing in her diary and writing a letter. The illustrations convey the feelings behind the text. To explain "magic," huge, glittery flowers appear. The characters and their world are transformed, demonstrated by the mouse flying over the glowing treetops with multicolored wings.

After years of exchanging books, letters and thoughts on the meaning of literature and life, Sara, mousy, disheveled, who has never been anywhere in her life--has really lived only for her work in a beloved bookshop, which has just closed its doors for the last time--bravely decides to accept her unknown friend's invitation to visit. But when she arrives, she finds her house empty, the funeral guests just heading home. . .<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sara finds herself alone. And what choice do the inhabitants of Broken Wheel have but to take care of their bewildered tourist? And what choice does Sara have, faced with a town where nobody reads and her desire to honour her friend, but to set up the perfect bookshop with all the books she and Amy shared--from Yann Martel's <i>Life of Pi</i> to Iris Murdoch and Jo Nesbo, to Bridget Jones and Doug Coupland's <i>All Families Are Psychotic</i> to <i>Little House on the Prairie</i>? And then watch as the townsfolk are, one by one, transformed in unexpected ways. . .<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the glorious tradition of <i>84 Charing Cross Road</i>, <i>The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society</i>, <i>Fried Green Tomatoes at the Whistle Stop Caf�</i>, Will Schwalbe's <i>The End of Your Life Book Club</i>, Jane Austen, and movies such as <i>You've Got Mail </i>and <i>Love Actually</i>, <i>The Readers of Broken Wheel Recommend </i>is a big-hearted, witty book about books, friendship, love--and always being open to the unexpected.</p><p><strong>An Amazon Best Book of January 2016:</strong> Much like champagne punch, Bivald&#x2019;s book-club-perfect tale of the tiny and slowly dying town of Broken Wheel, Iowa, is frothy and fun even as it sneaks up on you to deliver an emotional wallop. When Sara, a young Swedish woman who is at loose ends after losing her bookseller job, comes to visit her pen pal Amy in Broken Wheel, her first shock is that Amy has just died from a chronic ailment. The second surprise is that the citizens of Broken Wheel expect Sara to stay in Amy&#x2019;s house anyway. When Sara uncovers Amy&#x2019;s delightful stash of books, Sara decides to open a bookstore in the one-block-long downtown, inadvertently sparking a renaissance in Broken Wheel as the residents come together to help the store become a success. Garnished with plenty of book and character references from popular books such as <em>Fried Green Tomatoes at the Whistle Stop Cafe</em> and <em>Bridget Jones&#x2019;s Diary</em>, this charming fish-out-of-water story will remind you why you&#x2019;re a booklover. <em>&#x2014;Adrian Liang</em>KATARINA BIVALD grew up working part-time in a bookshop.

It chronicles May Day celebrations and forgotten children&#39;s games, the daily lives of farmworkers and craftsmen, friends and relations - all painted with the gaiety and freshness of observation that makes this a precise and endearing portrayal of country life at the end of the last century.This is the story of three closely-related Oxfordshire communities, a hamlet, a village, and a town, and the memorable cast of characters who people them.

The second edition, which adds Joanna Dewey to the authorial team, makes a good book even better. Substantial revisions improve and update the text.

Once, they roamed freely throughout western North America. Today, however, their territory has been greatly reduced. Now Ron Hirschi and Tom Mangelsen take readers into Yellowstone in search of the rare and majestic grizzly. Dramatic photographs and journal pages from Ron&#39;s field notebooks offer a glimpse of their actual encounters. Along the path of the grizzlies they came to observe, readers will also come face to face with a moose and her calf, herds of elk startled by the sound of the camera&#39;s shutter, and cutthroat trout glistening as the sun sets high in the Rocky Mountains.</p><p><b>Ron Hirsch </b>has written fifty books for children. He spends much of his time watching wildlife and helping young people protect streams and woodlands. He and his wife live on a small island within the rain shadow of the Olympic Mountains of Washington State.<br><br><b>Thomas Mangelsen </b>has dedicated his career to the appreciation and protection of the world's wildlife. His photos have been published in many nature magazines, and he was named the "Wildlife Photographer of the Year" in 1994 by the British Broadcasting Company (BBC).Gr. 3-5. Wildlife photographer Thomas Mangelsen provides beautiful color photos for this appealing picture-book-size introduction to grizzlies. Each spread combines Hirschi's smooth text, which includes facts about the bears' hibernation, eating habits, and physiology, with small inset images meant to represent a field journal written by Mangelsen and illustrated with drawings of footprints and plant life, created by Deborah Cooper. A box of bear facts will, along with Hirschi's text, support very basic reports. The vivid, breathtaking views of bears in their natural habitats, throughout the seasons, and the journal, recounting a bear-spotting trip to Yellowstone, give immediacy to the facts and may inspire readers to record their own accounts of outdoor experiences. Excellent for classroom use or personal reading for young naturalists. <i>Gillian Engberg</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

MacDonald&#39;s Travis McGee novels. We were giving him a brand-new, beautiful look; ingeniously, we used a deep blue color for THE DEEP BLUE GOOD-BY, a gold color for A DEADLY SHADE OF GOLD, a lavender hue for THE LONG LAVENDER LOOK, etc. But as I worked on the actual stories themselves, I realized that as colorful as these books now are on the outside, they&#39;re even more colorful on the inside. In order to prepare these books, we had to have them retyped from scratch; some of these books are so old that the plates had died, so we had nothing to print from. So all the books had to be proofread as if they were new books, and what a joy it was working on them. I unexpectedly rediscovered an author and character I knew very little about. Travis McGee is one of the great characters in crime fiction, and John D. MacDonald a fascinating storyteller. You never know what either is going to do next, or say next; what is going on in their minds is as important, if not more so, then what is going on outside Travis&#39;s boat. All of which add up to a heckuva fun series. Mark Rifkin, Managing EditorialWhen Travis McGee discovers a face from his past lying in a pool of blood on a cheap motel room floor, he wants answers. But so far, all he has are questions--plus the dubious inheritance of his friend's vengeance-driven girlfriend, and a valuable ancient Aztec golden idol. Part rebel, part philosopher, and every inch his own man, Travis McGee plunges into a wild and perilous trek for a killer that takes him from the Lauderdale beaches to the seething corruption of American expatriates in a distant Mexican town, to the lush high life of the California jet set.<br>"A master storyteller, a wizard of dialogue, characterization, and plot."<br>Chicago Tribune Book World</p><h2>Hoosier Group: Five American Painters</h2><p>Otto Stark, Theodore C.

But they don&#x2019;t. Mommy and Daddy, that is. They&#x2019;re gone. Poof! Maybe dead&#x2014;no one knows for sure.<br>You must see the problem here. Eight little girls on their own, no mommy or daddy to take care of them. This is not a good thing.<br>So now these little girls, must take care of themselves. Get to school, cook the meals, feed the cats (eight of them, too), and pay the bills. They can&#x2019;t ask for help, oh no. Any self-respecting adult would surely call in social services, and those well-meaning people would have to split them up. After losing their parents, being split up would be completely unbearable.<br>At the same time, the question remains:What happened to Mommy and Daddy? The Sisters Eight (as they are called, affectionately and otherwise) are determined to find out. Luckily, they do seem to have someone or something helping them. Notes keep appearing behind a loose brick in the fireplace.<br>It&#x2019;s a good old-fashioned mystery with missing (or dead) parents, nosy neighbors, talking refrigerators, foul-smelling fruitcake (is there any other kind?), and even a little magic.

At the same time. They were octuplets, you see.<br> Their names were Annie, Durinda, Georgia, Jackie, Marcia, Petal, Rebecca, and Zinnia. They were each born a minute apart on August 8, 2000. All eight had brown hair and brown eyes. And although they were all the same exact age, give or take a few minutes, each was one inch taller than the next, with Zinnia being the shortest and Annie the tallest. And their story always begins the same, so: Please stop reading if you have read about the Sisters Eight before, and go directly to chapter one.<br> Please keep reading if you have not read about the Sisters Eight before.<br> Please keep reading if you have read about the Sisters Eight before but your memory is lousy.<br> Please keep reading if you have read about the Sisters Eight before but you simply like the writing here and want to read this part over and over again.<br> Eight girls in one story, or one series of stories. This is bad news for boys, who may suspect that there are no snails or puppy dogs&#x2019; tails in this book. However, there might be snails and puppy dogs&#x2019; tails, but the only way you will ever know this is to read further. Remember: girls can be just as grubby as boys you just have to give them half a chance.<br> The family name of the Sisters Eight was Huit, which is French for eight and pronounced like wheat,&#x201d; as in cream of, which I hope you never have to eat. On New Year&#x2019;s Eve 2007, as you shall soon see, their parents disappeared, or died, one of the two this was a fine holiday present for the sisters, let me tell you. Parents disappeared, presumed dead, actually dead parents don&#x2019;t fare very well in children&#x2019;s stories these days, I&#x2019;m afraid. Best to be a child and not a parent, then.<br> The Sisters Eight lived in a magnificent stone house, which you will see more of very soon. It could practically have been a castle. It was therefore not the kind of house you would want to leave under any circumstances, certainly not after your parents had disappeared. Or died. You would not want to be taken away from your sisters, separated. And so they had to endeavor as you would no doubt do too to hang on to their home and to one another, keeping the truth away from the prying eyes of adults, who would surely split them all up like so many stalks of wheat cast upon the wind. Not an easy task sticking together with loved ones when you are seven, soon to be eight.<br> And where was this magnificent stone house? Why, it might have been anywhere in the world even right next door to you so why quibble? However, if there were octuplets in your class at school, you would probably have noticed by now, so perhaps that&#x2019;s not the case.<br> One thing was for sure: there were undoubtedly many cats in this almost castle, cats who would also have been taken away if word got out that the parents of the Sisters Eight had disappeared. Or died.<br> As we approach the beginning of our first adventure, it is that fateful New Year&#x2019;s Eve 2007 and the girls are about to discover the disappearance of their parents odd, the idea of discovering that which has disappeared as well as a note hidden behind a loose stone in the wall of the drawing room of their magnificent home. The note reads:<br><br>Dear Annie, Durinda, Georgia, Jackie, Marcia, Petal, Rebecca, and Zinnia,<br><br>This may come as rather a shock to you, but it appears you each possess a power and a gift. The powers you already have you merely don&#x2019;t know you have them yet. The gifts are from your parents, and these you must also discover for yourselves. In fact, you must each discover both your power and your gift in order to reveal what happened to your parents. Have you got all that?<br><br> The note is unsigned.<br> And what has happened to their parents? Well, we don&#x2019;t know that yet, do we? If we did, then this would be the end of our story, not the beginning . . .</p><h2>Crafting a Colorful Home: A Room-by-Room Guide to Personalizing Your Space with Color</h2><p><b>Knit, stitch, and paint your way to a more colorful and happy home with color expert and crafter Kristin Nicholas.</b><br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Learn how to make your home sing through handmade crafts and a bold use of color.

This is certainly true of the words he has teased out from contemporary spirituality to expound upon here. Each chapter is dedicated to so-called simple words such as <i>death</i>, <i>envy</i>, <i>masks</i>, <i>sex</i>, <i>good</i>, and <i>love</i>. Steinsaltz uses familiar language and progressive thinking to offer a greater moral and spiritual understanding to these core concepts. <p> Although many of the selected words are age-old, the accompanying commentary feels fresh and contemporary. When writing about envy, Steinsaltz explores how this misunderstood emotion can be used to serve the higher good rather than lowly desires. And in addressing the idea of sex, he writes, "Jewish tradition ... does not see sex per se as sinful.... It is a pleasure that is derived from giving and being connected with another--both in the body and beyond the physical plane; it can become a most meaningful expression of love, of charity, of benevolence. Sexual desire, possibly the most powerful human desire, can become an expression of holiness." <i>--Gail Hudson</i></p><b>Adin Steinsaltz</b> is internationally regarded as one of the leading scholars and rabbis of the modern era.

It also explores the real Woody Allen, the critically acclaimed filmmaker from the Upper East Side, and his amusing movie persona of a neurotic and lovable loser.<br>Shrewdly and effectively deconstructing Woody, John Baxter's biography illuminates Allen's preoccupation with sex and mortality, his personal quirks and obsessions, his manipulation of celebrity, and his cinematic achievement as chronicler and court jester of Manhattan's intellectual elite.<br>"A splendidly written, exhaustive account and a major achievement" - The Observer<br>"Astute and highly entertaining biography" - Daily Telegraph<br>"A bracing corrective to the usual po-faced, sycophantic studies of the cult of Woody" - Mail on Sunday<br>"Full of interesting information for cinema enthusiasts" - The Spectator<br>"The saga [of Woody and Mia] makes compulsive reading" - The Guardian<br></p><p>The biographer of Steven Spielberg (1997) and Stanley Kubrick sets his sights on one of the cinema's great comic minds. Born Allen Stewart Konigsberg, the filmmaker grew up in wartime Brooklyn, a period and neighborhood to which he returned in such films as Radio Days. Baxter contends that his father's unstable job situation and the family's constant shuffling between relatives early in his life left Allen with a long-standing resentment of his parents and his religion. He mines the films for examples, noting for instance that the parents of the characters Allen plays are masked when they appear onscreen. Baxter is not the first person to find Allen's personal life in his films, a hobby that has grown since scandal enveloped Allen's personal life when he left longtime partner Mia Farrow for her adopted daughter Soon-Yi Previn, his current wife. But he suffers more than most biographers from an inability to distinguish the man from the artist. Peering into every one of Allen's films, he analyzes the repeated use of prostitutes, the references to Judaism, the jokes about therapy. For Baxter, a joke is never just a joke, but a desperate cry for help. When he does move away from a minatory pseudoanalysis, as when he describes Allen's early career as a comedy writer, his tale is at its most entertaining. Baxter tells of Danny Simon, Neil Simon's brother, who gave Allen one of his first jobs; of Allen's partnership with Larry Gelbart, who years later would create M*A*S*H; and of Allen's break writing for Buddy Hackett's series, ``Stanley.'' Such episodes, set during the heady initial days of TV, offer Allen anecdotes new even to diehard fans. Unfortunately, these are among the only chapters that offer anything fresh or unbiased. Most of Baxter's digging has a desperate, leftover look. Allen's fans, who are presumably Baxter's target audience, will prefer to let his films do the talking. -- <i>Copyright �1999, Kirkus Associates, LP. All rights reserved.</i>Given the maelstrom of Allen's recent life, this engaging new biography is welcome, even if not definitive. Baxter (The Hollywood Exiles) follows Allen's tangled amours and artistic discoveries from his childhood in Brooklyn through his stint as a 1950s comedy writer and onward, exhaustively detailing the making of movie after movie, from What's New, Pussycat? to Deconstructing Harry. Fair-minded but harsher than Eric Lax was in Woody Allen (1991), Baxter has done yeoman work in canvassing the published record (he lacked Lax's access to Allen and his peers). While Baxter unearths eerie tidbits about Allen's relations with two teenage girls, his psychologizing often rests on others' judgments, such as film theorist Maurice Yacowar's views on sex and death, and Allen's ex-partner Mia Farrow's take on the gap between nebbish persona and hard-nosed auteur. He considers Allen's affair with Farrow's adoptive daughter Soon-Yi more a lapse of taste than an indictable offense. Cinephiles will particularly enjoy Baxter's discussions of Allen's influences: he finds an early debt to Jules Feiffer, hears echoes of Fellini in Annie Hall and describes the brief involvement in Stardust Memories of French student radical Daniel Cohn-Bendit. (As a critic, Baxter likes the comedies more than the dramas.) Allen finds real happiness, Baxter concludes, not in his messy private life but in his work. Though the reader might wish for a broader attempt to sum up Allen's prodigious output and place in American culture, this book remains the most detailed look at an AmericanAnay, New YorkAoriginal.

But mostly I&#39;ve lived inside my head and inside books. Burning Man, the subject of my first book, is an opening to a world where I could be encouraged to actually grapple with the physical world at its starkest and harshest-hot metal, burning wood, pulsing kerosene jets, a place where I learned how to dig and plane and trench and assemble and weld (a little) and try to reconcile my brain with my body and with the physical world. In a way, I could say I wasn&#39;t fully born until discovering the subject matter of my first book. I&#39;m a man made of books, always reading a dozen at a time, and I&#39;ve loved hundreds. But my soul and intellect were most sparked, most propelled in fruitful directions, by the elegant and wild imaginings of science fiction writers like Gene Wolfe and Barry Malzberg; by the 20th century&#39;s most anarchistic and inspirational epic, Robert Shea and Robert Anton Wilson&#39;s Illuminatus!; and by the political and economic writings of Murray Rothbard and Ludwig von Mises, who helped teach me what freedom could mean and how it could work. Brian Doherty is a senior editor at Reason magazine, a monthly focusing on politics and culture. He has written for dozens of publications, ranging from the Washington Post to USA Today to Salon.com, and his work has been anthologized in many books. He lives in Los Angeles and has attended Burning Man for the past nine years.It's tough to categorize Burning Man. Is it an excuse for thousands of anarchic, sexually uninhibited people to do drugs and destroy things? A massive, do-it-yourself arts festival for the punk avant-garde? Or is it the "spontaneous flowering" of a new, subversive culture? <i>Reason </i>magazine editor Doherty explores these definitions and others in this gushing yet well-researched mix of journalism and memoir. Burning Man began in the mid-1980s, when some friends burned a wooden effigy on a California beach. The event soon relocated to the Nevada desert, where, apparently, the civilized world's rules no longer applied. People could play golf with burning toilet paper rolls or whip each other at the Temple of Atonement. One year, someone piled 10 tons of half-burned pianos on top of each other, creating a huge "metapercussion instrument." Another year, a man calling himself "Dr. Megavolt" donned a metal suit and danced with electricity generated by a towering Tesla coil. By 2003, more than 30,000 pilgrims were participating, and Burning Man had become a $6-million "culture business" that many saw as a sellout of its humble origins. Doherty is an enthusiastic devotee, and he adds his own memories to this account. This insider's look at a cornerstone of American subculture is informative, though nearly as chaotic as Burning Man itself.

This time, Owen is to journey to Wales, his long-unseen homeland, to recruit archers for the Duke of Lancaster, bolstering the Dukes forces against a rumored (soon-to-come) attack on England by King Charles of France. Owen is accompanied by Geoffrey Chaucer, whose mission is to inspect and report on the fortifications at the Dukes Welsh castles, overseen by his steward John Lascelles. Traveling with them are Owens ailing father-in-law, Sir Robert DArby, and Brother Michaelo, the Archbishops secretary, both on a pilgrimage to St. Davids shrine. Owen is to meet with John de Reine, the stewards son, at Castle Carreg Cernen, but de Reines murdered body has been left at the Tower Gate of St. Davids. Owen and Geoffrey offer to escort the body, in company with Father Edern, to his fathers home at Castle Cydweli. Once there, a second killing occurs and Lascelles beautiful wife Tangwystl vanishes, along with Father Edern. Tangwystls father is Gruffydd, deeply involved in a money scam and said to have ties to the infamous traitor Owain Lawgoch. There are endless comings and goings, a surfeit of characters and conflicts, and much soul-searching as Owen rediscovers his roots, suffers a deep personal loss, identifies the killer, and prepares to return home.

Reprint.</p><p>District Attorney Butch Karp and his pistol-packing wife Marlene Ciampi, the liveliest crime-fighting couple in New York, are back in <i>True Justice</i>. The first set of infanticides happen on Butch's watch: a wave of gruesome incidents in which newborns are killed or abandoned by their indigent teenage mothers. The second, Marlene's case, is straight out of the headlines: a middle-class college girl and her boyfriend are indicted for first-degree murder in the death of their baby after a concealed pregnancy.<p> The most interesting story belongs to Lucy, Butch and Marlene's teenage daughter, an incisively brilliant and complex young woman who deserves her own novel. Lucy's best friend's parents seem to have been murdered by an African furniture restorer of whose guilt Lucy is unconvinced. The real solution to the mystery of who killed the Maxwells is telegraphed well in advance, but all the crimes give Butch, Marlene, their colleagues in criminal justice, and even Lucy a chance to weigh in on the law's fault lines and the ironies implicit in what passes for justice in America. But it's Lucy's spiritual quest that provokes the book's most unusual and involving drama. Lucy's devout Catholic faith, like her prodigious talent for language (she can speak 14, but give her five days in a foreign country and that'll be 15, thank you), is a mystery to Butch, a lapsed Jew, and Marlene, who has trouble squaring her own faith with the violence that attends her job. When a Jesuit priest tries to explain it in the following passage, Butch is nonplused: </p><p> </p><blockquote>"Lucy takes her spiritual responsibilities very seriously. And of course, in the current age, when people think there's no such thing as spiritual responsibility, she has nothing to compare herself to, and so she may get herself painted into a corner." <p> "I'm not sure I follow," said Karp. </p><p> "Oh, I mean, two or three hundred years ago, a girl with her talents and predilections would have been in an order, with hourly guidance and a rule to follow. Think of Mickey Mantle being born in, say, Romania in 1830. The talent's there, but there's no cultural space for it."</p></blockquote> <p> This is a keenly intelligent book, many cuts above the usual courtroom procedural. The most interesting things happen outside the courtroom--the moral dilemmas, the political choices, the bonds between parents and daughter. The pacing is as swift as the dialogue, the characters are piercingly illuminated, and the philosophical jousting is worth a room full of Jesuits. This reader is heading straight for Tanenbaum's backlist and eagerly anticipating another novel with Lucy as the star. --<i>Jane Adams</i></p>Robert K.

B/W illustrations.</p><p>On a cold morning just a few days into the year 1800, the citizens of the southern French village of Saint-Sernin awoke to a strange vision: a hairy boy, naked, who appeared as if by some witchcraft from the nearby woods. Captured while digging up vegetables from a tanner's garden, the boy did not--could not--speak. Instead, he emitted a few weird cries, trying to hide himself from his puzzled captors.<p> The next day, the gendarmes took the boy to a hospice in a nearby town. From there, writes the historian and literary scholar Roger Shattuck, his path took this "prisoner without a crime," now called Victor, into the studies and laboratories of revolutionary France, where the boy presented a rare homegrown instance of Rousseau's "noble savage" to the civilized world. Much scholarly and scientific debate surrounded him. Finally, Victor, now famed as the "wild boy of Aveyron," came under the care of a sympathetic young doctor who concluded that Victor was in fact an abandoned deaf-mute, intelligent but forlorn, who had somehow been able to survive on his own. Dismissed in a contemporary encyclopedia as "half wild" and "incapable of learning to speak in spite of all efforts to teach him," Victor was eventually forgotten. "A state pension kept him alive, like an animal in a zoo," writes Shattuck, "and when he died no one noticed." Scientific debate about his condition was renewed from time to time, however, and the story of the wild boy was influential in the development of several theories of language learning and human evolution. Shattuck's slender narrative is a fine work of scholarly detection, yielding an instructive episode in the history of science. <i>--Gregory McNamee</i></p>Roger Shattuck won the National Book Award in 1975 for his acclaimed biography, MARCEL PROUST.

The detailed entries cover desultory peacetime action, administrative minutiae and desperate battles in the same terse military jargon: on January 28, 1922, for example, "Marines assist in rescue work after the roof of a theater collapses in Washington," while the entry for March 1, 1944, at the height of the Iwo Jima battle ("Marine aircraft participate in TF 58 strikes on Okinawa"), includes the laconic note that "VMSB 332 is redesignated VMTB 332." The march of dates and acronyms is interrupted by engaging two-page vignettes that feature loving descriptions of rifles and machine guns, tales of heroism and profiles of prominent Marines, including the "irrepressible" Major General Smedley Butler, who later soured on the Corps and denounced expeditions he had led in the Caribbean as an imperialist "racket." Innumerable photos and reproductions of paintings by Marine artists provide sometimes gritty, sometimes sentimental glimpses of Marine life and combat. Scholars will find the chronology of real value, while the trove of Marine lore will spark reminiscences among leathernecks.

One of Britain&#39;s greatest historians combines his own and others&#39; essays from earlier collections with pieces previously unpublished in volume form.</p><p>A. J. P. Taylor (1906-1990) was the most famous and controversial historian of the twentieth century. Author of over thirty books, the three peaks of his scholarship are the massive and authoritative <i>The</i> <b>Struggle for Mastery in Europe: 1848-1918</b><i>,</i> the idiosyncratic <b>English History: 1914-1945</b> and the revisionist <b>Origins of the Second World War</b><i>. </i>But there was much else. <b>The Trouble Makers: Dissent Over Foreign Policy (1792-1939)</b><i> </i>was his own personal favourite. The essay often saw A. J. P. Taylor at his best, it was a medium well-suited to his pithy, provocative, epigrammatic style. After his death the best of his essays were selected and reassembled by Chris Wrigley into three volumes: <b>From Napoleon to the Second International</b><i>,</i> <b>From the Boer War to the Cold War</b> and <b>British Prime Ministers</b><i>.</i>A companion to Taylor's essays on nineteenth-century Europe (From Napoleon to the Second International ), this volume gathers the brilliant British historian's book reviews and essays about this century's wars and political personalities. So many books have been written on such matters that it seems unprofitable to go back to old reviews, but Taylor's style dispels the fear. He was so steeped in the subjects that rarely did he feel obliged to simplify what the author was saying; he forged ahead with his own opinions, curtly and challengingly expressed, confident that his newspaper's readers wanted to hear them and secondarily those of the author to which he was responding. Generally, his opinions still stand up across the 75 subjects he addresses; a characteristic exposition is "War by Time-Table," a dissection of the assassination and foolish brinkmanship that ignited World War I. Taylor's gloomy, Tacitean approach to history favored human accident over "inevitability," which made him an incisive, entertaining commentator on politicians' foibles. That acerbic talent endures in this delight for history browsers. <i>Gilbert Taylor</i></p><h2>Notes from the Underground: The Whittaker Chambers--Ralph De Toledano Letters, 1949-1960</h2><p>Never-before-published collection of letters between Chambers, a former Communist agent, and journalist Ralph de Toledano.</p><p>For the first time: the only known contemporaneous written record of Whittaker Chambers&#39;s thoughts during the trial of Alger Hiss. In 1948, Chambers, a former Communist agent, and a Time magazine editor, fingered Hiss, a senior State Department official, as a Soviet spy - triggering the most famous espionage trial in American history. Ralph de Toledano, the Newsweek reporter covering the Hiss trial (technically for perjury), quickly became close friends with Chambers. The two men began exchanging letters in 1949 and continued for the rest of Chambers&#39;s life. Now, in Notes from the Underground: The Whittaker Chambers-Ralph de Toledano Letters, 1949-1960, these letters have been collected and made available for the first time. Chambers, best known for his moving personal memoir, Witness, is portrayed here as a man of deep philosophical and spiritual thought. Included are Chambers&#39;s reflections on the state of American liberalism, his opinions of Joseph McCarthy and Richard Nixon, his words of personal anguish suffered after the close of the trial, and his thoughts on the fate of Western civilization.An intriguing and illuminating correspondence between two of America's earliest cold warriors. In 1948, Whittaker Chambers (himself a former Communist agent then employed as a senior editor at Time magazine) exposed Alger Hiss as a Soviet spy. At no small cost, he made his accusation stick, and the liberal poster boy eventually served five years in a federal penitentiary on perjury charges. In the meantime, Manhattan-based de Toledano (then a Newsweek reporter) became a trusted friend of the wary Chambers, who had retreated to a working farm he owned in Maryland. The two soon began writing each other with some regularity, and their letters offer the hair-down commentary of insiders on an eventful era during which Hiss was twice in the dock; de Toledano published Seeds of Treason, a conservative tome; Chambers had an even more successful bestseller (his memoir Witness); the Korean conflict raged; and the political fortunes of Richard Nixon waxed, then waned. Deeply concerned about the Red Menace, the perceived perfidy of the left, and the future of conservatism, the pen pals could be gossipy, even snide, in their assessments of allies, intellectual or otherwise--William Buckley, Bennett Cerf, Dwight Eisenhower, Arthur Koestler, Henry Luce, Joseph McCarthy, et al. Nor did they shy from sharing workaday worries involving appropriate outlets for the articles they were writing, the inadequate terms of book contracts, and the well-being of their children. In like vein, de Toledano (who turned 81 in August) and Chambers were not above strutting their intellectual stuff. The correspondence tails off in 1957, when Newsweek assigned de Toledano to its Washington bureau (within easy reach of exurban Maryland) and ends altogether less than one year before Chambers's death in mid-1961. A contemporary window on a remarkable friendship and a divisive decade, which should give considerable pause to those who recall the 1950s as some sort of golden age without strife. -- <i>Copyright �1997, Kirkus Associates, LP.

Twenty minutes into the meeting the presenter finally makes it to slide four of a thirty two- slide deck. At least you can read this one, unlike the others, which were crammed with numbers, graphs and charts. You look around, wondering if anyone else is following the presentation.<p>Just about everyone these days suffers from information overload the 24/7 explosion from our computers, smartphones, media, colleagues, and customers. Information is essential to making intelligent decisions, but more often than not, it simply overwhelms us. It's like trying to drink from a fire hose.</p><p>The question isn't how to stop all those e-mails, meetings, conference calls, and fat reports; that's impossible. The question is what to do with them. How do you find the truly essential nuggets of information and use them with confidence?</p><p>The solution proposed by Christopher Frank and Paul Magnone sounds deceptively simple: Learn how to ask the right questions at the right time. Whatever field you're in, asking smarter questions will expose you to new information, point you to connections between seemingly unrelated facts, and open new avenues of discussion with your colleagues.</p><p>The authors explain the seven questions that can help you bring a big- picture perspective to problems that often leave others buried in irrelevant details. And they show through real-life case studies- including Trader Joe's, Starbucks, Kodak, Microsoft, iRobot, and IBM-how their method can have a dramatic impact. It really is possible to convert the fire hose of information into useful insights.</p><p>Consider a nonbusiness example: the 2010 Icelandic volcano eruption that sent a giant ash cloud toward Europe. Tens of thousands of flights were canceled and five million passengers stranded, leading to billions in economic losses. Europe's best scientists generated oceans of data and carefully modeled the cloud's dispersion pattern. But no one could answer the essential question: Was the concentration of volcanic ash in the air enough to damage a jet engine? Without that key answer, all the carefully gathered facts were useless to the decision makers.</p><p>Once you adopt the seven questions, you'll start having more productive brainstorming sessions. You'll answer critical questions faster and find unexpected solutions to important problems. And you'll get better at communicating to your colleagues with more clarity and focus, turning down the fire hose that other people have to cope with.</p></p><p><b>Christopher Frank</b> is a vice president at American Express, where he is responsible for advertising, brand, and business - to - business research.

His novels have sold over ten million copies worldwide. Born in Southampton, Freemantle entered his career as a journalist, and began writing espionage thrillers in the late 1960s.

Freemantle lives and works in London, England.</p>Charlie Muffin is the world's most unusual, unlikely, yet somehow believable secret agent. As in the earlier novels in this engaging series, Charlie is on the bad side of everyone in his agency except the director. That may or may not hinder him when he is sent to Japan to help the wife of a KGB assassin who is about to defect to the CIA, in order to defect to the British secret service. An elaborate double cross? Perhaps. But Charlie, irreverent, disreputable, and disrespectful as he is, is most of all, very good at what he does. Hayward Morse's version of Charlie is perfect. The combination of grit and resonance in his voice makes him sound like a seedy, aging, footsore operative who has complete confidence in himself, and none in anyone else. His Russians are also entirely believable. A grand listen.

While many books, both in Hebrew and English, have explored the theoretical Kabbalah, virtually nothing has been published regarding the meditative methods of these schools. This is the first book published in any language that reveals the methodology of the Kabbalists and stresses the meditative techniques that were essential to their discipline. Kaplan offers a lucid presentation of the mantras, mandalas, and other devices used by these schools, as well as a penetrating interpretation of their significance in light of contemporary meditative research.<br><br>In addition, <i>Meditation and Kabbalah</i> presents relevant portions of such meditative texts as the Greater Hekhalot (textbook of the Merkava School), the writings of Abraham Abulafia, Joseph Gikatalia's Gates of Holiness, Gate of the Holy Spirit (textbook of the Lurianic School), and the important meditative hasidic classics. Also investigated is the intriguing possibility, suggested by the Zohar, that the meditative methods of the East might have been derived from the mystical techniques of the prophets.</p><p><b>Rabbi Aryeh Kaplan</b> was born in New York City and was educated in The Torah Voda'as and Mir Yeshivot in Brooklyn.

This process is called "initiation" or "vision quest" in many traditional&nbsp;societies and can loosely be considered some dangerous variety of self-psychotherapy in modern terminology. I do not recommend it for&nbsp;everybody . . . briefly, the main thing I learned in my experiments is that "reality" is always plural and mutable." - Robert Anton Wilson from the Preface</p><p>"I don't see how to take death seriously. I look forward without dogmatic optimism, but without dread. I love you all and I deeply implore you to keep the lasagna flying."&nbsp;Author of some 35 books including&nbsp;<i>Cosmic Trigger</i>,&nbsp;<i>Prometheus Rising</i>,&nbsp;<i>Schrodinger's Cat Trilogy</i>, and co-author of the&nbsp;<i>Illuminatus!

Nazi propaganda, in particular, has been the topic of countless books, as have the personalities involved in the German propaganda machine. Yet, despite all of the efforts in this regard, one aspect of that propaganda study has remained largely unexamined. It is the regime&#39;s use of postal materials as a tool for expressing its propaganda message. In this new, profusely illustrated book, Albert L. Moore offers readers an overview of the images and messages that filled the mailboxes of Hitler&#39;s subjects and victims. As official documents of Nazi Germany, the stamps, postcards, and even postmarks used during the time provide the reader with an explicit picture of the types of propaganda messages every German was expected to see and act upon on a daily basis. Moore&#39;s groundbreaking work helps us to better understand this powerful, yet heretofore unrecognized, weapon in Hitler&#39;s propaganda arsenal. This is not merely a book for those interested in stamps or postcards as collectibles, it is a book for those who desire to better understand what it was like to live inside the Third Reich!</p><p></p><h2>The Notebooks of Robert Frost</h2><p><p> Robert Frost is one of the most widely read, well loved, and misunderstood of modern writers. In his day, he was also an inveterate note-taker, penning thousands of intense aphoristic thoughts, observations, and meditations in small pocket pads and school theme books throughout his life. These notebooks, transcribed and presented here in their entirety for the first time, offer unprecedented insight into Frost's complex and often highly contradictory thinking about poetics, politics, education, psychology, science, and religion--his attitude toward Marxism, the New Deal, World War--as well as Yeats, Pound, Santayana, and William James. Covering a period from the late 1890s to early 1960s, the notebooks reveal the full range of the mind of one of America's greatest poets. Their depth and complexity convey the restless and probing quality of his thought, and show how the unruliness of chaotic modernity was always just beneath his appearance of supreme poetic control. </p><p> Edited by preeminent Frost scholar Robert Faggen and annotated to help readers with the poet's more elusive references, the notebooks are also thoroughly cross-referenced, marking thematic connections within these and Frost's other writings, including his poetry, letters, and other prose. This is a major new addition to the canon of Robert Frost's writings. </p></p><p>Robert Faggen is Barton Evans and H. Andrea Neves Professor of Literature, Claremont McKenna College.<br>The notebooks bring Frost alive as a person and poet, showing him in the process of thinking through, rethinking, and formulating many of his most important beliefs, ideas, observations, and epigrams. They will generate considerable scholarship both confirming and reevaluating central issues of Frost's life, thinking, and writing. The notebooks are interesting in themselves. They show a remarkable intelligence at work and provide access to the (typically concealed) processes underlying Frost's performances, as well as a catalog of his most important concerns. Also important are Frost's more general observations on human nature and behavior and on social and governmental organization (these often struck me as remarkably prescient of contemporary scientific and philosophical views.) Faggen's book will be crucial to Frost scholars and students. It will moderate, modify, and intensify existing truisms and debates about Frost's person, opinions, and processes, and it will open new areas for consideration.<br> --Guy Rotella, Professor of English, Northeastern University<br><br>This work deserves a place with other editions of major writers such as Emerson, Thoreau, and Twain. One measure of the importance of this edition is that it demonstrates that Frost belongs in the company of America's greatest writers, whose significance grows with our access to their complete works. It was a pleasure to read these notebooks. <br> --Timothy Materer, Professor of English, University of Missouri<br><br>What modern poet's mental privacy would we rather invade than that of the sly, vexingly evasive Robert Frost? Robert Faggen serves as a reliable guide, conducting us backstage where we are allowed to observe Frost's off-duty pen as it drifts from aphorism to speculation, from opinion and verbal doodling to&#x2014;yes&#x2014;the poetry itself.<br> --Billy Collins<br><br>Frost was a deliberate, masterly, and sometimes enigmatic poet, and these qualities show in his notebooks. Faggen offers a beautifully crafted introduction to this superb annotated and cross-referenced volume. The value of this work is tremendous.<br> --Anthony J. Elia (<i>Library Journal</i> 2006-11-01)<br><br>A new book containing unpublished work by America's most famous poet is a literary event. While he was not much of a diarist, Frost avidly kept notebooks throughout his life. He recorded his daily musings in what Frost scholar Faggen calls '"ordinaries," unassuming dime-store spiral pads and school theme books.' This roughly chronological (the poet abandoned and then resumed writing in some notebooks) and thoroughly annotated edition offers devotees a substantial glimpse of the workings of Frost's complex and often contradictory mind, though it provides little in the way of narrative. In scattered jottings on poetry, teaching, politics and family--to name just a few of the many topics covered--Frost drafts poems ('And oh but it was fetching/ To see the wretches retching'); theorizes about poetics ('The Poem must have as good a point as a [sic] anecdote or joke'); lists topics for later writings ('Subjects used in 1906 Eng classes...Things My Mother Keeps to Remember My Infancy by'); spins aphorisms, stories and sketches; and even shows the development of famous quotes ('No surprise to author none to reader'). Better suited to flipping around in than reading straight through, this is an essential book for Frost fans and serious poetry lovers, who will find it to be a trove of Frost's famously earthy and yet deceptively simple wisdom, as well as a damn good read. (<i>Publishers Weekly</i> 2006-11-20)<br><br>While those such as Eliot and Stevens shivered with distaste at the idea of writing poetry that was intelligible to the masses, Frost was determined to evolve a style that would appeal both to an average poetry consumer and, through its secret equivocations, to the more discerning reader. Ideally, it would educate the former, and transform them into the latter...In 1915, Frost returned to the US as something of a celebrity, and shrewdly set about cultivating, on the one hand, a popular audience and, on the other, the esteem of influential critics. <i>The Notebooks of Robert Frost</i> offer an intriguing insight into Frost's mind. They are not, it should be said, at all systematic. The first entries in Notebook 4, for instance, were made in 1909, and the last in the 1950s. Some contain drafts of work in progress, others fragments of lectures and notes for classes. Their scrupulous, perhaps over-scrupulous, editor Robert Faggen, has chosen to reprint the contents of all 49 notebooks in their entirety...While only the most devoted of Frost scholars will find their attention held by every page, this is a great book to open at random...Frost once described poetry as a 'momentary stay against confusion.' There's plenty of confusion in these notebooks, but they also offer a series of vivid glimpses into how and why he fashioned each 'momentary stay.'<br> --Mark Ford (<i>Financial Times</i> 2006-03-11)<br><br><i>The Notebooks of Robert Frost</i> [is] seven hundred pages of wisdom and prophecy, raving and rant, expertly edited and annotated by Robert Faggen...The biggest surprise in <i>The Notebooks of Robert Frost</i>, sixty years of private jottings in preparation for poems and prose, is the spectacular profusion of epigrams, aphorisms, and what Frost called 'dark sayings.'<br> --Christopher Benfey (<i>New Republic</i> 2007-01-22)<br><br>The American poet Robert Frost was not keen on having his rough drafts inspected by posterity. Few survive for his poems. Here for the first time, however, are 47 pocket flip-pads, diaries and school exercise books that record his life as a poetic thinker...Frost's notebooks illuminate the oblique concerns of his [poetry].<br> --Jeremy Noel-Tod (<i>Daily Telegraph</i> 2007-01-20)<br><br>Since Frost used his notebooks to think through his poems, his essays and his teaching, they reveal only his working mind--and that's revelation aplenty... By now, nobody buys Frost's old image as a rustic autodidact or a versifying Andy Rooney. He read as widely and deeply as any American poet--the notebooks allude to the likes of Dryden, Marx, Nietzsche, Freud, Einstein, Santayana and Maria Montessori--and funny as he was, he could still outbleak T. S. Eliot. He was also American poetry's biggest ham (at least until Allen Ginsberg), and his poems were performances: not just in his well-known public readings but on the page. These deliberately preserved notebooks, too, might have kept one eye on an audience. But unlike the much-revised poems, they sometimes show this least innocent of men taking himself by surprise.<br> --David Gates (<i>Newsweek</i> 2007-02-05)<br><br>Frost was as innovative as many poets more often considered 'experimental'...He's a technician of prodigious agility, yet he generally limited himself to iambics, and favored rhymes like 'reason' and 'season' or 'star' and 'far'...Unlike almost every poet of comparable ability, Frost can claim a general reading audience, especially among readers who want poems that 'make sense'--yet his aesthetic is evasive, arguably manipulative, and has at its core a freezing indifference that would make the neighborhood barbecue awfully uncomfortable...Any Frost reader will benefit from Faggen's thoughtful introduction and be intrigued by the way in which concepts from these largely aphoristic journals animate the poems and vice versa...More than four decades after his death, this most American of American poets still fits uncomfortably into our country's favorite aesthetic categories.<br> --David Orr (<i>New York Times Book Review</i> 2007-02-04)</p><h2>Inside a Pearl</h2><p>Edmund White was forty-three years old when he moved to Paris in 1983. He spoke no French and knew just two people in the entire city, but soon discovered the anxieties and pleasures of mastering a new culture. White fell passionately in love with Paris, its beauty in the half-light and eternal mists; its serenity compared with the New York he had known. Intoxicated and intellectually stimulated by its culture, he became the definitive biographer of Jean Genet, wrote lives of Marcel Proust and Arthur Rimbaud. Frequent trips across the Channel to literary parties in London begot friendships with Julian Barnes, Alan Hollinghurst, Martin Amis and many others. When he left, fifteen years later, to return to the US, he was fluent enough to broadcast on French radio and TV, and as a journalist had made the acquaintance of everyone from Yves St Laurent to Catherine Deneuve to Michel Foucault. He&#39;d also developed a close friendship with an older woman, Marie-Claude, through whom he&#39;d come to a deeper understanding of French life. Inside a Pearl vividly recalls those fertile years, and offers a brilliant examination of a city and a culture eternally imbued with an aura of enchantment.</p><p>Edmund White is the author of many novels, including the classic A Boy's Own Story and the most recent Jack Holmes &amp; His Friend; two previous memoirs, My Lives and City Boy; biographies of Jean Genet, Marcel Proust, and Arthur Rimbaud; and several other works of non-fiction, including The Flaneur. He lives in New York City and teaches writing at Princeton University.White is an acclaimed novelist, essayist, biographer of Genet and Proust, and a self-described &#x201c;archaeologist of gossip.&#x201d; In his third memoir, he recounts the 15 years he spent in France, cataloging the famous people he met, interviewed, befriended, and slept with. In fact, the circles White moved in were so tight and overlapping, it appears that the only people he knew who were not prominent were the men he picked up. White is renowned for the purity of his style and for his frank depictions of sex, and he is in peak form here. For White, identity is sexual identity. He records the tastes and appetites of dear friends, acquaintances, and complete strangers. For him, sex&#x2014;whether they have it, whom they have it with, how they have it&#x2014;is their defining characteristic. He is wise in his portrayal of the French, and there are tender moments, notably his recollections of his old friend Marie-Claude (MC), who did so much to introduce him to Paris and its peculiarities. But his principal concerns are fame, money, and, yes, sex. --Michael Autrey</p><h2>Writing the Cozy Mystery</h2><p>Do you want to write a mystery but don&#x2019;t have a clue where to start?

In contrast to most contemporary political historians, Barone (senior writer, US news and world report ) argues that Americans have more often charted their political fortunes by cultural allegiances regional, ethnic, religious, rural, and urban than by economic struggles. Annotation copyright Book News, Inc. Portland, Or.</p><p>A whistle-stop survey of U.S. politics from Franklin Roosevelt to George Bush, with visits at what seems like each biennial election, poll, primary, and policy question of these six decades. More than anything else it resembles a deluxe edition of The Almanac of American Politics (Barone &amp; Co., 1982), of which Barone is coauthor, a blend of observation, statistical analysis, and minutiae. At points the book is good, as when Barone uses polling data to illuminate Truman's surprise 1948 victory over Dewey. But his overall theme of the primacy of cultural over economic issues isn't new, and with pronouncements such as, "the whole country in the middle 1980s seemed at peace with itself," occasionally Barone lands somewhere between the fatuous and the meaningless. Some political junkies will feast, but most readers will do better with any one of several more general sur- veys, most recently James MacGregor Burns's The Crosswinds of Freedom (LJ 4/1/89).<br><i>- Robert F.

Weiss, M.D.Many of us grapple with how to stay happy, calm, and focused in a world that seems to get more complex by the minute. How do we keep our wits about us, our mood stable, and our memory intact when our brains and bodies are bombarded with information and influences from every side? This one-of-a-kind resource combines cutting-edge science with compassion and wisdom to offer answers we can really use.Heal Your Mind continues the three-pronged healing approach that Dr. Mona Lisa Schulz and Louise Hay pioneered together in All Is Well: Heal Your Body with Medicine, Affirmations, and Intuition. Here, it&#x2019;s applied to aspects of the mind ranging from depression, anxiety, and addiction to memory, learning, and even mystical states. You&#x2019;ll learn what&#x2019;s going on in your brain and body when you feel sad, angry, or panicked; you have trouble focusing, reading, or remembering; a past trauma is clouding your mind in the present; and more. And in each chapter, you&#x2019;ll get a "virtual healing experience" through case studies in the All Is Well Clinic, where Dr. Mona Lisa uses medical intuition to pinpoint issues in a wide range of prototypical client histories and she and Louise offer solutions and affirmations to help restore well-being. Today, we tend to think our minds and bodies need an endless array of expensive, ever-changing pharmaceutical interventions. In truth, medicines are just one approach to healing the mind; nutritional supplements also support mind-body health; and affirmations restore us to balance by changing the way we think.Heal Your Mind puts all these tools at your disposal to help you choose your own path.</p><p>Dr. Mona Lisa Schulz is an internationally renowned expert in Medical Intuition and Mind-Body Medicine.

He served a long tenure (1947&#x2013;1971) as president of the Hebrew Union College and oversaw the merger of HUC with the Jewish Institute of Religion. He expanded the Cincinnati-based institution to include schools in New York, Los Angeles, and Jerusalem.

Chocolate reigns supreme on a short list of national treasures, ranking right up there with Ted Williams and Mickey Mouse. Add a dose of American ingenuity and you've got the perfect recipe for indulgence.<br><br>In this lovingly compiled collection of sweet treats both plain and fancy, Lora Brody builds an irresistible case or eating chocolate morning, noon, and night. In chapters entitled The Candy Store, Comfort Me with Chocolate, Chocolate for Breakfast, Isn&#x2019;t It Romantic?, and more, she presents the stuff of which a chocolate lover's dreams are made. Start the day with Chocolate Chip Pancakes with Chocolate Butter or Chocolate Monkey Bread, perk up a lunch box with homemade Whoopie Pies or Chocolate Caramel Cheesecake Brownies, or take a trip down memory lane with Tunnel of Fudge Cake and real Boston Cream Pie. Set a festive mood with White Chocolate Heath Bar Cheesecake or Chocolate Raspberry Torte. There's even a section of fun-to-make chocolate favorites that are perfect for kids. Whether the occasion is a formal celebration requiring a showstopper, a casual meal with family, or simply an after-school snack, there is a chocolate indulgence to make the moment that much sweeter. Lora Brody's always letter-perfect recipes guarantee this is a collection chocolate lovers will return to time and again.</p><p>Having confessed her jones for chocolate in <i>Growing Up on the Chocolate Diet: A Memoir with Recipes</i> Lora Brody celebrates her love affair with the Dark Lord in her cookbook, <i>Chocolate American Style</i>. What she calls American style might best be summed up as, "I want it and I want it now!" To which Lora Brody responds with, "Just how would you like to deliver chocolate to your mouth?" She leaves no chocolate base unturned.<p> Candy? There's an entire chapter (the complexities of melting and tempering are covered in Chapter One, "A Primer for the Home Cook," in which the author spells out what you need and what to do with it, fast and sweet and easy, with the marvelous closing line at the open door, "remember that no matter what your dessert looks like, the fact that you took the time and energy to make it instantly puts it ten pegs above anything you could buy a store."). You might think breakfast was out of the question, Cocoa Puffs aside. To which the author delivers chocolate caramel sticky buns, chocolate chip pancakes with chocolate butter, and chocolate-filled monkey bread. Brody moves through flans, pudding, pies, fudge cakes; through birthday cakes, marble cakes, tortes, and ice cream rolls; through home-made ice cream, fudge sauce, chocolate sauce, and frappe; through Old World faves brought here by our immigrant elders. She tackles pound cakes, cookies, brownies galore, moon rocks, chocolate squares and, Russell Crowe Bars, which border on don't ask don't tell. She encourages in a chapter all its own--"Kids in the Kitchen"--recruiting children to the ways of the Dark Lord. Shameless. And then there's romance. Make that, "Romance." Again, an entire chapter that distills the essence of the romantic gesture into all manner of chocolaty deliciousness.</p><p> Brody is a consummate pro--20 cookbooks into a sterling career--and she doesn't miss a beat. She knows a thing or two about producing a recipe that delivers. Some cookbooks come from the heart. <i>Chocolate American Style</i>, on the other hand, comes straight from the Lora Brody's central nervous system.

What does economic theory say about ordering from a menu? Or attracting the right mate? Or controlling people who talk too much in meetings? Or dealing with your dentist? With a wryly amusing voice, in chapters such as &#x201c;How to Control the World, The Basics&#x201d; and &#x201c;How to Control the World, Knowing When to Stop&#x201d; Cowen reveals the hidden economic patterns behind everyday situations so you can get more of what you really want.</p><p>Readers will also gain less selfish insights into how to be a good partner, neighbor and even citizen of the world. For instance, what is the best way to give to charity? The chapter title &#x201c;How to Save the World&#x2014;More Christmas Presents Won&#x2019;t Help&#x201d; makes a point that is every bit as personal as it is global.</p><p>Incentives are at the core of an economic approach to the world, but they don&#x2019;t just come in cash. In fact, money can be a disincentive. Cowen shows why, for example, it doesn&#x2019;t work to pay your kids to do the dishes. Other kinds of incentives--like making sure family members know they will be admired if they respect you--can work. Another non- monetary incentive? Try having everyone stand up in your next meeting if you don&#x2019;t want anyone to drone on. Deeply felt incentives like pride in one&#x2019;s work or a passing smile from a loved one, can be the most powerful of all, even while they operate alongside more mundane rewards such as money and free food.</p><p><i>Discover Your Inner Economist</i> is an introduction to the science of economics that shows it to be built on notions that are already within all of us. While the implications of those ideas lead to Cowen&#x2019;s often counterintuitive advice, their wisdom is presented in ordinary examples taken from home life, work life, and even vacation life... How do you get a good guide in a Moroccan bazaar?</p><p><b>Read Tyler Cowen's posts on the Penguin Blog.</b></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p></p><p>Tyler Cowen is a professor of economics at George Mason University. He is a prominent blogger at marginalrevolution.com, the world&#x2019;s leading economics blog. He also writes regularly for <i>The New York Times</i>, and has written for <i>Forbes, The Wall Street Journal, Newsweek, The Washington Post, The Los Angeles Times</i>, and <i>The Wilson Quarterly.</i>Reviewed by Carlos Lozada<p>"We are all Keynesians now," President Nixon is said to have declared in 1971.</p><p>His words affirmed the influence of John Maynard Keynes, the famed British economist who decades earlier had argued that smart governments could fine-tune a nation's economy and avert major slumps by manipulating taxes and spending.</p><p>These days, though, big-think economic theories feel a little pass�. Why worry about inflation or unemployment or budget deficits when you can use economics to figure out why hotel mini-bars are so expensive? Or why people pay for gym memberships they rarely use? Or which first name will maximize your newborn's lifetime earnings?</p><p>We may have been Keynesians once, but times change. We are all Freakonomists now.</p><p>Steven D. Levitt and Stephen J. Dubner's 2005 bestseller, Freakonomics, captivated readers by using economics to demystify the little conundrums of daily life. I'd never wondered what schoolteachers and sumo wrestlers have in common, or why drug dealers live with their moms, but somehow Levitt and Dubner made me care.</p><p>It hardly took an economist -- freakish or otherwise -- to recognize a new market. A glut of similar books soon emerged, such as Tim Harford's The Undercover Economist, Robert H. Frank's The Economic Naturalist and, now, Tyler Cowen's Discover Your Inner Economist.</p><p>The books have much in common, including food imagery on their covers. Freakonomics shows an apple cut open to reveal an orange inside. (Message? Expect the unexpected!) Discover Your Inner Economist dangles a carrot. (Incentives are everything!) And The Economic Naturalist puts a pie chart next to an actual slice of pie. (Theory becomes practice!) </p><p>But open the covers, and the differences are notable. Inner Economist may not be the best organized or most gracefully written, but it could prove the most useful of the lot, especially if you share the author's interests. An economics professor at George Mason University, Cowen has written extensively on art and ethnic dining, and his chapters exploring those topics are particularly engaging. </p><p>The key to tapping your Inner Economist, Cowen explains, is the ability to identify people's true incentives, which are usually more than money. Suppose you want your daughter to help out around the house by washing dishes. Should you pay her?</p><p>Bad idea, Cowen warns. If you explain that washing dishes is her family responsibility, she may not always obey, but at least she'll feel some obligation. Bring payment into the picture, and her motivation changes. It becomes a market transaction, writes Cowen, and "the parent becomes a boss rather than an object of deserved loyalty." Your daughter will be less likely to reach for the Palmolive and more inclined to find part-time work that earns respect from her friends. "Expect dirtier dishes," Cowen concludes. </p><p>If you're visiting an art museum, your Inner Economist has tips to improve your experience. In each room, decide which painting you'd steal. "This forces us to keep thinking critically about the displays," Cowen writes. "If the alarm system was shut down and the guards went away, should I carry home the Cezanne, the Manet, or the Renoir?" If imaginary theft gives you qualms, pretend you're shopping. "We are probably better trained at shopping than looking at pictures," Cowen explains. How would you spend $500,000 at the Met? The smaller your imaginary budget, the better chance you'll avoid famous paintings and find interesting, lesser-known works.</p><p>Cowen also offers techniques for fine dining. At upscale restaurants, many people mistakenly order items they could easily cook at home. Instead, Cowen suggests, "order the item you are least likely to think you want." Chances are, you'll be happily surprised.</p><p>And if you're seeking great food overseas, Cowen offers ruthless economic logic: "It sounds heartless, but look for a big gap between the rich and the poor." Wealthy people are a strong market for tasty food, Cowen argues, and poor people will cook for low wages. "My meals in Mexico, India, and Brazil are typically delicious and cheap," he says. </p><p>Cowen encourages readers to disregard so-called sunk costs -- the money or time we've already spent on something -- and to make decisions based on future prospects. If a waiter doesn't know what entr�e to recommend, walk out of the restaurant. If a movie is boring, leave halfway. If the book you're reading isn't "the best possible book I can be reading right now," find another.</p><p>That's all very well, I suppose. But what if finding parking near another restaurant could consume half your evening? What if you're at that movie with a date? And what if that book you're reading is, say, Discover Your Inner Economist?</p><p>Perhaps the ultimate affirmation of the Freakonomics phenomenon -- beyond the spate of copycat books -- is the backlash it has sparked. In April, the New Republic published an essay decrying the rise of "cute-o-nomics," lamenting that "clever" topics are crowding out important economic research.</p><p>If anything, I'd imagine Freakonomics helps the economics profession, attracting new students and making the dismal science a smidgen less dismal. When's the last time you saw someone thumbing through Keynes's General Theory at the beach?</p><p>Yet Keynes remains instructive here. Nixon's praise, ironically, came just as traditional Keynesianism began to fall from favor. High inflation and persistent unemployment during the 1970s undermined the notion that governments can ensure economic stability. Alternative economic theories soon prevailed, at least for a while.</p><p>Maybe the Freakonomics craze is peaking as well. Sure, it's fun to use economic principles to unravel everyday riddles. But cutting-edge researchers are going further, deploying the tools of psychology and neuroscience to probe economic behavior, using imaging technology to map our brains and understand how we invest, buy and save. Now that's freaky.</p><p>Copyright 2007, The Washington Post.

Thus, unlike commentaries that simply append theology to historical criticism, Fowl's volume displays disciplined attention to the text of Philippians in ways that enhance rather than frustrate theological inquiry.<br><br> While Fowl engages the great scholars of the past, John Chrysostom and Thomas Aquinas among them, he also draws a novel theology of friendship from Paul's letter and unpacks how the teachings of Philippians might be embodied today by Christians in the West.</p><p>Stephen E.

By the Pulitzer Prize-winning author of The Stone Diaries. 200,000 first printing. Tour.</p><p>Larry Weller is a regular guy, or so Carol Shields has him think. When we first meet him in 1977 Winnipeg at age 26, he's pondering the pluses of Harris tweed, still living at home, and realizing he's in love with his girlfriend, Dorrie, a flinty car saleswoman. Larry is proud of his job at Flowerfolks, even though he fell into floral design by accident, and if his relationship with his parents isn't perfect, it's not too bad, either. (Stu and Flo Weller may have less page-time in <i>Larry's Party</i>, but they are hugely memorable. He is a master upholsterer, happiest when working; she is a woman ruined by nervous guilt, having inadvertently killed off her mother-in-law with some improperly preserved green beans.) <p> Carol Shields has said that she had "always been struck by the fact that in most novels people aren't working." Though her hero climbs the floral managerial trellis for 17 years and finds more rhapsody in work than marriage, Larry and Dorrie's honeymoon in England points him toward what will be his true vocation--mazes. These living constructs turn him into a thinker, a man of imagination, and the author's descriptions are quietly spectacular as well as effortlessly sweet. Larry wonders at their "teasing elegance and circularity ... a snail, a scribble, a doodle on the earth's skin with no other directed purpose but to wind its sinuous way around itself." Just as Larry changes with the times--each elliptical chapter ages him by one or two years--so does his art. In 1990, he designs a maze in which you can't really lose yourself. In 1997, the McCord Maze "is intended to mirror the descent into unconscious sleep, followed by a slow awakening." Larry, too, has a slow awakening, taking several false turns before reaching midlife. As the novel closes, with a bravura dinner party scene, he may finally be at ease in the world. But his creator knows that he is only halfway there, and still has to negotiate his way from the center of the maze to its exit.</p><i>The Stone Diaries</i> marked a new phase in a literary career already ablaze with achievement. As well as the many international awards it received, including the Pulitzer Prize, the National Book Critics Circle Award and the Governor General's Award, the book also met with universal critical acclaim and topped bestseller lists around the world. "Carol Shields," raved <i>Maclean's</i>, "has crafted a small miracle of a novel." " <i>The Stone Diaries</i>," said the <i>New York Times Book Review</i>, "reminds us again why literature matters." <br> <br> <i>The San Diego Tribune</i> called <i>The Stone Diaries</i> "a universal study of what makes women tick." Now, in <i>Larry's Party</i>, Carol Shields does the same for men. <br> <br>Larry Weller, born in 1950, is an ordinary guy made extraordinary by his creator's perception, irony and tenderness. <i>Larry's Party</i> gives us, as it were, a CAT scan of his life, in episodes between 1977 and 1997 that flash backward and forward seamlessly. As Larry journeys toward the new millennium, adapting to society's changing expectations of men, Shields' elegant prose transforms the trivial into the momentous. We follow this young floral designer through two marriages and divorces, his interactions with parents, friends and a son. And throughout, we witness his deepening passion for garden mazes -- so like life, with their teasing treachery and promise of reward. Among all the paradoxes and accidents of his existence, Larry moves through the spontaneity of the seventies, the blind enchantment of the eighties and the lean, mean nineties, completing at last his quiet, stubborn search for self. <br> <br>Larry's odyssey mirrors the male condition at the end of our century with targeted wit, unerring poignancy and faultless wisdom.</p><h2>The Gentleman and the Faun: Encounters with Pan and the Elemental Kingdom</h2><p>In the &#34;Scientist and the Faun&#34; the reader follows Robert Ogilvie Crombie&#39;s (ROC&#39;s) experiences and encounters with Pan and the elemental kingdom in the Botanic Garden in Edinburgh and the path that led him from there to the Findhorn Community where he encountered more elementals and fauns. In one conversation with Pan at the Botanic Garden ROC talks about other people being jealous of his abilities and asks why he is able to see Pan and the elemental kingdom and receives this reply from Pan: Communicating with my subjects is not a garden game for the odd half hour when there is nothing better to do. It is of vital importance for the survival of mankind. Unless humanity comes to realize the dangerous stupidity of outraging nature and stops the ever-increasing rate of pollution it will ultimately destroy itself. Seeking cooperation between the three kingdoms - the Devic, the Nature and Humanity&#39;s, as is an aim at Findhorn, is one way of helping mankind to survive. ROC gave many lectures over the years on his experiences with the nature kingdoms all of which have been incorporated into this new book. This book includes new material by David Spangler, Dorothy McLean and other Findhorn community members sharing their experiences of ROC and his abilities.</p><p>Robert Ogilvie Crombie (1899 - 1975), also known as ROC, was born in Edinburgh, Scotland in 1899 and lived there for most of his life. Crombie abandoned his career as a scientist due to ill health, and moved from his town house in the city of Edinburgh to the country near Perth, Scotland, to be able to have closer contact with nature. This later developed into a communication with the inner spirit of the nature kingdom. His account of some of these experiences are published in &#39;The Findhorn Garden&#39; a book about the early history of the Findhorn Foundation in the north east of Scotland. His verbal account of his encounters with nature spirits, accompanied by photographic slides of nature was part of the educational programme at Findhorn for many years. He was cited by his friend, the Findhorn co-founder Peter Caddy as a major influence. ROC died in 1975.</p><h2>The Courtship Basket (An Amish Heirloom Novel)</h2><p><p><strong>The second book in Amy Clipston&#x2019;s bestselling Amish Heirloom series!</strong></p><p><strong>&#x201c;</strong><strong>Readers will be engaged not only with Rachel and Mike&#x2019;s romance, but also with the slowly unwinding story told by Rachel&#x2019;s mother about her courtship days with Rachel&#x2019;s father.&#x201d; &#x2014;<em>RT Book Reviews</em></strong></p><p><strong>Years ago, a picnic basket brought two hearts together.

Commentaries by Tatsuzo Shimaoka, Dr. Lennox Tierney and Martha Longenecker. Foreword by Sori Yanagi.</p><p>FOREWORD <p>Sori Yanagi President, Nihon Mingeikan, Tokyo </p><p>I would like to thank Martha Longenecker, Founder and Director of Mingei International Museum and longtime friend of Tatsuzo Shimaoka, for this marvelous opportunity of introducing Shimaoka's works to the people of the United States. Shimaoka was awarded the title of Ningen Kokuho (Living National Treasure of Japan) in 1996. As one of the most respected potters in Japan, his works have been highly acclaimed at museums and galleries worldwide. </p><p>When Shimaoka was a teenager, wondering what to do when he grew up, he visited the Nihon Mingeikan (Japan Folk Crafts Museum in Tokyo) in 1938. There he discovered the beauty of Mingei advocated by my father, Soetsu Yanagi (1889-1961). Shimaoka had found what he wanted to become. Shimaoka met Yanagi, Founder of the museum, and was able to meet the most passionate advocates of Yanagi's Mingei Movement: Shoji Hamada, Kanjiro Kawai and Bernard Leach. </p><p>Shimaoka began making pottery in 1939 as a student at the Tokyo Institute of Technology's Department of Ceramics. During Shimaoka's freshman year, he visited Hamada in Mashiko and was granted apprenticeship upon graduation. Shimaoka joined Hamada's workshop from 1946-49. Four years later, he built his own, independent kiln adjacent to his teacher's in Mashiko. </p><p>Leonardo da Vinci once said that a true teacher is one that can instruct pupils to surpass the teacher. Hamada, the master potter and educator, always emphasized to his students the importance of creating their own personal styles. Shimaoka later became famous for his original technique of Jomon Zogan (rope-impressed inlay) and is now the second Mashiko potter, after Hamada, to be designated a Living National Treasure.</p></p><h2>Plague Ship</h2><p>Great example of Slaughter&#39;s skill as a novelist</p><p>7 1.5-hour cassettes</p><h2>Loved By a Warrior (The Warrior King, 2)</h2><p>Donna Fletcher returns to the Scottish Highlands with <em>Loved by a Warrior</em>, the second sensuous story in her magnificent Warrior King series, continuing the thrilling saga of four brave warriors destined to return the legendary king of Scotland to his throne.

She can never love without bringing death&#x2014;and though her powerful Highlander champion tempts her beyond imagining, she fears that to give herself to him means his downfall. And yet she knows she must tempt Fate . . . for to resist him would be just as unthinkable.</p><p>Part of the fun in writing, Donna Fletcher admits, is doing the research.

My very favorite book (and one that stands out in my mind--and with much affection--to this day) is Tunnel in the Sky. I really, really wanted to go off to explore new worlds with a covered wagon and horses, like the hero does at the very end of the book. But one of the nice things about Robert Heinlein is that he's got something for everyone. One of my best friends has a different favorite: Podkayne of Mars. Go figure.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;--Shelly Shapiro, Executive EditorROBERT A.

As our environment is subjected to increasing assault from climatic changes and pollutants, conservation has become a growing concern. The first chapter of this text considers the political and institutional development of nature conservation and reviews the physical and biological nature of Britain, its geology, climate and wildlife habitats. Subsequent chapters cover the loss of habitats and species, how these losses have been managed and the techniques used to survey and monitor the integration of nature conservation policies in industries from agriculture to forestry and fisheries. Marren continues by discussing how nature conservation has emerged from the sidelines to become a major concern. He addresses the role of the media, weighs up the successes and failures of the conservation movement and looks to what the future may hold.</p><p>Peter Marren is a trained ecologist who worked as a woodland scientist, conservation officer and author-editor with the Natural Conservancy Council between 1977 and 1992. He has written numerous books and articles and contributes regularly to British Wildlife. Marren is the author of the highly successful commemorative New Naturalist volume, The New Naturalists.</p><h2>The Unfree French: Life Under the Occupation</h2><p>The swift and unexpected defeat of the French Army in 1940 shocked the nation. Two million soldiers were taken prisoner, six million civilians fled from the German army&#x2019;s advance to join convoys of confused and terrified refugees, and only a few managed to escape the country. The vast majority of French people were condemned to years of subjugation under Nazi and Vichy rule. This compelling book investigates the impact of the occupation on the people of France and dispels any lingering notion that somehow, under the collaborating government of Marshal P�tain, life was quite tolerable for most French citizens.<br><br>Richard Vinen describes the inescapable fear and the moral quandaries that permeated life in German-controlled France. Focusing on the experiences of the least privileged, he shows how chronic shortages, desperate compromises, fear of displacement, racism, and sadistic violence defined their lives. Virtually all adult males festered in POW camps or were sent to work in the Reich. With numerous enthralling anecdotes and a variety of maps and evocative photographs, <i>The Unfree French</i> makes it possible for the first time to understand how average people in France really lived from 1940 to 1945, why their experiences differed from region to region and among various groups, and why they made the choices they did during the occupation.</p><p><b>Richard Vinen</b> is on the faculty of the Department of History, Kings College, University of London.During the years 1940-44, the French were forced by circumstances to adjust personally to the German occupation, and circumstances worsened (lethally for French Jews) as the war lengthened. Therefore, the historical distinction between collaboration and resistance is questionable when it comes to understanding French society in these years, and Vinen stresses the tough circumstances in both material and psychic terms. In the humiliation of the 1940 defeat, Vinen discerns the emasculation felt by two million captured French soldiers taken back to forced labor in Germany. These imprisoned men were a major influence on how those back in France coped, as their absence compelled a substantial number of women to shift for themselves. Exploring French society operating under the restrictions of occupation, Vinen refrains from overgeneralization and draws sympathy, especially for those women with liaisons to Germans, who were denounced after liberation as collaborators. Privation and loneliness are the dominating moods of Vinen's social history, which offers an alternate perspective to the political and military histories that dominate the subject of occupied France. <i>Gilbert Taylor</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

The sea was choppy, as Quinn Thompson stood silently on the deck, looking up at the sails, savoring his last few moments aboard her. He didn't mind the weather or the gray day, or even the rough seas. He was an inveterate and seasoned sailor. The Victory was a hundred-fifty-foot sailboat, with auxiliary engines, that he had chartered from a man he had done business with frequently in London. Her owner had had business reversals that year, and Quinn had been grateful to have use of the boat since August. He had used her well, and the time he had spent aboard had been good for him in every way. He was healthy, strong, and more peaceful than he had been when the trip began. He was a handsome, vigorous, youthful-looking man. And more than he had been in months, he was resigned to his fate.<br> <br> He had boarded the yacht in Italy, and after that spent time in Spanish and French waters. He had hit a traditionally rough patch in the Gulf of Lions, and relished the excitement of a brief and unexpected storm. He had sailed on to Sweden and Norway afterward, and returned slowly through several German ports. He'd been on the boat for three months, and it had served a useful purpose. It had given him all the time away that he needed, time he had used well to think and recover from all that had occurred. He had been stalling his return to California for months. He had no reason to go home. But with winter setting in, he knew he couldn't delay his return much longer. The owner of the Victory wanted her in the Caribbean for his own use by Christmas, as they had discussed when they agreed to the charter. Quinn had paid a fortune for three months aboard, but he didn't regret a penny of it. The stiff price of the charter meant nothing to Quinn Thompson. He could afford that, and a great deal more. Materially and professionally, he had been a very lucky man.<br> <br> The time on board had also served to remind him of how passionately he loved sailing. He didn't mind the solitude, in fact he thrived on it, and the crew were both expert and discreet. They had been impressed by his skill, and quickly realized he knew far more about the Victory, how to sail her hard and well, than did her owner, who knew next to nothing. Above all, for Quinn, she had provided both a means of escape and a gentle haven. He had particularly enjoyed his time in the fjords, their stern beauty seemed to suit him far more than the festive or romantic ports in the Mediterranean, which he had assiduously avoided.<br> <br> His bags were packed in his cabin as he stood on deck, and, familiar with the efficiency of the crew by then, he knew that within hours of his departure, all evidence of his time aboard would have vanished. There were six male crew members on board, and one woman, the wife of the captain, who acted as stewardess. Like the others, she had been discreet and polite, and rarely said much to him, and like the owner, the entire crew was British. And he and the captain had enjoyed a comfortable and respectful rapport.<br> <br> "Sorry for the chop on the way in," the captain said with a smile as he joined Quinn on deck. But he knew by now that Quinn wouldn't mind. Quinn turned to nod at him, undisturbed by the waves breaking over the bow, and the rain beating down on them. He was wearing foul weather gear, and in fact, he liked the challenge of hard sailing, rough seas, and the occasional storm. The only thing he didn't like was leaving. Quinn and the captain had spent hours talking about sailing, and the places they'd been. And the captain couldn't help but be impressed by Quinn's extensive travels, and the depth of his knowledge. Quinn Thompson was a man of many hats and many faces, a legend in the world of international finance. The yacht's owner had told the captain before Quinn arrived that he had been a man of humble beginnings who had made a vast fortune. He had even gone so far as to call him brilliant, and after three months on the boat with him, the captain didn't disagree with that opinion. Quinn Thompson was a man whom many admired, some feared, a few hated, sometimes with good reason. Quinn Thompson was direct, sure, powerful, mysterious in some ways, and unrelenting about anything he wanted. He was a man of infinite ideas, endless imagination in his field, and few words, except when he was in one of his rare expansive moods, which the captain had enjoyed as well, usually after a few brandies. For the most part, they had kept their conversations confined to sailing, a topic that they both enjoyed, more than any other.<br> <br> The captain knew Quinn had lost his wife the previous spring, and Quinn had mentioned her once or twice. There were times when a wistful look came over him, and some somber days in the beginning. But for most of the hours they stood beside each other on deck, Quinn kept his own counsel. The captain knew he had a daughter as well, because he'd mentioned her once, but Quinn seldom talked about her either. He was a man who was quick to share ideas, but rarely feelings.<br> <br> "You ought to make Mr. Barclay an offer for the Victory," the captain said hopefully as the crew took down the sails, and he turned on the motor, glancing at Quinn over his shoulder as they headed into port. Quinn smiled in answer to the comment. His smiles were hard won, but when they came, they were well worth it. They lit up his face like summer sunshine. The rest of the time, and far more frequently, he seemed lost in winter. And when he laughed, he was a different person.<br> <br> "I've thought about it," Quinn admitted, "but I don't think he'd sell her." Quinn had asked John Barclay before chartering her, if there was any chance he would, and Barclay had said only if he had to, and had admitted he would give up his wife and children before his sailboat, a point of view Quinn both understood and respected. He didn't repeat the comment to the captain. But in the past three months, Quinn had fallen in love with the idea of buying a boat. He hadn't owned one in years, and there was no one to stop him now.<br> <br> "You should have a boat, sir," the captain ventured cautiously. He would have loved to work for him. Quinn was hard but fair, respectful, and exciting to sail with. He had done things with the Victory, and gone places, John Barclay would never have dared or dreamed of. The entire crew had loved the three months they had spent sailing for Quinn Thompson. And Quinn himself had been thinking of buying or building a boat since August, especially now that his months on the Victory were over. It would be the perfect answer to getting out of San Francisco. He had already decided to sell the house, and was thinking of buying an apartment somewhere in Europe. At sixty-one, he had been retired for nearly two years, and with Jane gone, he had no reason to stay in San Francisco. He realized that a boat might restore joy to his life. In fact this one already had. He hated the fact that people often disappointed each other. But boats never did.<br> <br> "I've been coming to the same conclusion myself all morning," Quinn said quietly. He hated to leave the Victory, and he knew she was sailing in two days for Gibraltar, and after that to St. Martin, where her owner was meeting her for Christmas with his wife and children. The price Quinn had paid to charter her was helping Barclay to afford her, and had made an enormous difference. She would surely be his for at least another year as a result. "Do you know of anything comparable up for sale at the moment?" Quinn asked with interest, as the captain kept his eyes straight ahead, watching their course as they came into the channel, and he pondered the question.<br> <br> "Nothing up to your standards, I suspect, not a sailboat." There were always large power boats changing hands, but fine sailboats of the caliber Quinn would want were harder to come by. In most cases, their owners loved them--and wouldn't part with them easily. He was still thinking about it when the first mate joined them, and the captain asked him the question, and Quinn was intrigued when the young man nodded.<br> <br> "I heard about one two weeks ago, when we left Norway. She's not finished yet, but she's up for sale. She's still in a shipyard in Holland. Bob Ramsay commissioned her last year, and he just decided to sell her. He wants a bigger one. I hear the one for sale's a beauty." All three men knew she would be if she had been commissioned by Bob Ramsay, he was a notable sailor with three handsome yachts he competed with in all the European races, and he generally took all the prizes. He was an American with a French wife and they lived in Paris. He was a hero in the international sailing world, and all the boats he had built were exquisite.<br> <br> "Do you know which yard she's in?" Quinn asked, suddenly wondering if this was the answer to his prayers, as the young man brightened.<br> <br> "I do. I'll call them for you, if you like, as soon as we dock."<br> <br> Quinn was leaving on a flight to London that afternoon, spending the night at a hotel, and flying to San Francisco the next morning. He had called his daughter, Alex, in Geneva about seeing her before he flew home, and she had said she was too busy with the children. He knew the real reason for her not seeing him, and he no longer had the energy to fight it. The battles between them were too bitter and had gone on for too long. She had never forgiven him for what she perceived as his failures in her childhood. And she had told him months before that she would never, ever forgive him for calling her so late in her mother's illness. In fact, he realized now that blind hope and denial had kept him from calling her earlier than he had. Both he and Jane had refused to believe she would actually die. They kept telling themselves and each other that she would survive. And by the time Jane agreed to let him call their daughter, it was only days before the end....</p><h2>The Children of Odin (Barnes &amp; Noble Library of Essential Reading): Nordic Gods and Heroes</h2><p><i>The Children of Odin: Nordic Gods and Heroes </i>(1920) is a lyrical introduction to the myths and epic legends of the ancient Scandinavians. Fusing the disparate mythic accounts of his medieval sources, Irish-American poet <b>Padraic Colum</b> fashions a powerful tale of the divine adventures of gods and men, locked in an inexorable march of fate.&nbsp; Written in a style accessible to both children and adults, Colum's work offers a haunting and evocative portrait of the mythic world of the Viking Age.</p><p><b>Padraic Colum</b> was born in 1881 at Collumbkille, County Longford, Ireland, and was the oldest of eight children.&nbsp; He was active in the Gaelic League and Irish Republican Army, and wrote plays for the Abbey Theatre, the premiere dramatic venue for Irish playwrights at the turn of the twentieth century.&nbsp; He was acquainted with the prime movers of the Irish literary renaissance, including James Joyce, William Butler Yeats, and Lady Gregory.&nbsp; In 1914, he emigrated from Ireland and settled in the United States, where he began a new career writing storybooks for children.&nbsp; By the end of his career, he had published over fifty works.&nbsp; He died in 1972.</p><h2>The Natural Step for Communities: How Cities and Towns can Change to Sustainable Practices</h2><p><p>Sustainability may seem like one more buzzword and cities and towns like the last places to change, but <i>The Natural Step for Communities</i> provides inspiring examples of communities that have made dramatic changes toward sustainability and explains how others can emulate their success.</p><p>Chronicled in the book are towns like �vertorne�, whose government operations recently became 100 percent fossil fuel-free, demonstrating that unsustainable municipal practices really can be overhauled. Arguing that the process of introducing change&#x2014;whether converting to renewable energy or designing compact development&#x2014;is critical to success, the authors outline why well-intentioned proposals often fail to win community approval and why an integrated approach&#x2014;not "single-issue" initiatives&#x2014;can surmount challenges of conflicting priorities, scarce resources and turf battles.</p><p>The book first clarifies the concept of sustainability, offering guiding principles&#x2014;the Natural Step framework&#x2014;that help identify sustainable action in any area. It then introduces the 60+ eco-municipalities of Sweden that have adopted changes to sustainable practices throughout municipal policies and operations. The third section explains how they did it and outlines how other communities in North America and elsewhere can do the same. Key to success is a democratic, "bottom-up" change process and clear guiding sustainability principles, such as the Natural Step framework.</p><p>The book will appeal to both general readers wishing to understand better what sustainability means and practitioners interested in introducing or expanding sustainable development in their communities.</p><p>Sarah James is the principal of a community planning consulting firm.

Several thousand insurgents, given a voice in the communiques of Subcomandante Marcos, took control of the capital and other key towns and held the Mexican army and government at bay for weeks. Proclaiming themselves the Zapatista Army of National Liberation, they captured both land and headlines. Worldwide, people wanted to know the answer to one question: why had revolutionaries taken over a Mexican state? </p><p>No other study of Chiapas answers that question as thoroughly as does this book. The uprising and government's armed occupation of the state are but the latest violent episodes in a region that is now and has always been a rich land worked by poor people. By studying the impoverishment of the laboring class in Chiapas, Benjamin addresses how the Chiapan elite survived the Revolution of 1910 and remain in control of the state's development and destiny. More clearly than anyone else, Benjamin shows in his new final chapter that the contemporary agrarian uprising is the legacy of Chiapan underdevelopment.</p></p><p>Benjamin delineates the basic continuity in the history of Chiapas from the 1890s to 1995.Thomas Benjamin is a professor of history at Central Michigan University.</p><h2>No Mean Soldier: The Story of the Ultimate Professional Soldier in the SAS and Other Forces (Cassell Military History)</h2><p>Absolutely incredible, and brutally honest, this amazing story recounts the adventures of a British SAS soldier turned mercenary.

In 1966 the historian Sheila Fitzpatrick traveled to Moscow to research in the Soviet archives. This was the era of Brezhnev, of a possible 'thaw' in the Cold War, when the Soviets couldn't decide either to thaw out properly or re-freeze. Moscow, the world capital of socialism, was renowned for its drabness. The buses were overcrowded; there were endemic shortages and endless queues. This was also the age of regular spying scandals and tit-for-tat diplomatic expulsions and it was no surprise that visiting students were subject to intense scrutiny by the KGB. Many of Fitzpatrick's friends were involved in espionage activities &#x2013; and indeed others were accused of being spies or kept under close surveillance. In this book, Sheila Fitzpatrick provides a unique insight into everyday life in Soviet Moscow. Full of drama and colorful characters, her remarkable memoir highlights the dangers and drudgery faced by Westerners living under communism.<p></p></p><p>Sheila Fitzpatrick is Honorary Professor of History at the University of Sydney and Emerita Professor of History at the University of Chicago, USA. One of the most acclaimed historians of twentieth-century Russia, she is the author of several books, including <i>The Russian Revolution</i>;<i> Stalin's Peasants</i>; <i>Everyday Stalinism</i>; and <i>Tear off the Masks!</i>A Spy in the Archives is the insanely redable crowning achievement of a distinguished career, a book every historian should dream of writing. Through the autobiographic report of her visit to the Soviet Union, she tells a story of bureaucratic hassles but also of deep and lasting personal friendships. Slavoj Zizek The vanished world of Brezhnev&#39;s Russia brought to life with unususal erve, a disarming candour and a shrewd eye for telling detail.

A new and more biblical way to overcome fear.</p><p>Terry Wardle, formerly executive director of Alliance Theological Seminary in Nyack, New York, has a D.Min. from Fuller Theological Seminary. Wardle, the founder of Spring Meadow Retreat Center in Northern California, is an associate professor in the Christian Ministries Department at Ashland Theological Seminary. He is also the author of Draw Close to the Fire: Finding God in the Darkness.Many of us struggle with fear. I know in my own life the role fear has played and its no place to live. In Whispers of Love in Seasons of Fear Terry Wardle helps us to face our fears, but even more importantly he directs us to Jesus loving embrace and glorious light that shines so brightly in the darkness of our fears. I believe this book will help many to see the light of Jesus at the end of the tunnel as they battle with the issue of fear -- <i>Dave Dravecky</i><br><br>Terry Wardle has written a most insightful and helpful book. He delivers us from fruitless shoutings at fear itself and takes us to its roots in what he so rightly calls "the dark places of the soul" and the "desert." He calls us to vulnerability and corporateness and gives much needed practical counsel about how best to allow brothers and sisters to meet us in the hurtful depths to bring healing and freedom from fear. Most appealingly, he takes what everyone knows, that "perfect love casts out fear," and brings it out of platitudes into effective practicality. I liked especially, his catalogues of the lies that entrap us, and his use of the Word of God and the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ for healing. This book is a must for Christian counselors - and any lay Christian who is called upon occasionally to help someone else out of the pits of fear - and its depths of panic -- <i>John Loren Sandford, co-founder, Elijah House, Inc.</i><br><br>Wardle doesnt just offer a formula for dealing with fears often paralyzing effects. Instead, he honestly opens himself up in a vulnerable way, clearly showing that this book isnt an academic exercise but a glimpse into the grace hes received in dealing with his own fear. This [book] represents a different and possibly deeper approach to understanding fear. Contains insights that will liberate many whove struggled with fear -- <i>Devlin Donaldson, CBA Marketplace, April 1999</i></p><h2>One Thousand Wells: How an Audacious Goal Taught Me to Love the World Instead of Save It</h2><p>Jena Nardella, cofounder of Blood:Water and one of <i>Christianity Today</i>&#x2019;s 33 Under 33, shares how her passion for saving the world grew into a humbler long-term calling of loving the world in all its brokenness in this beautifully written memoir.<br><br>Ten years ago, Jena Lee Nardella was a fresh-out-of-college, twenty-something with the lofty goal of truly changing the world. Armed with a diploma, a thousand dollars, and a dream to build one thousand wells in Africa, she joined forces with Grammy Award&#x2013;winning band Jars of Clay to found Blood:Water and begin her mission.<br> <br>Jena's dream for her nonprofit turned that initial $1 into $20, and then $100, and today into more than $25 million. Working throughout eleven countries in Africa, Blood:Water has provided healthcare for over 62,000 people in HIV-affected areas and has partnered with communities to provide clean water for more than one million people in Africa. But along the way she faced many harsh realities that have tested her faith, encountered corruption and brokenness that nearly destroyed everything she'd fought for, and taught her that wishful thinking will not get you very far. Jena discovered that true change comes only when you stop trying to save the world and allow yourself to love it, even when it breaks your heart.<br> <br>With a fresh, intelligent, and winsome voice, Jena Lee Nardella weaves an evocative personal narrative filled with honest and hard-won lessons that demonstrate the amazing things that can happen when you fight for your dreams.</p><p>Jena Lee Nardella is the cofounder of Blood:Water, which she started ten years ago at the age of twenty-two with the band Jars of Clay. Following her vision and leadership, the organization has brought clean water access to more than one million people in Africa and provided healthcare for more than 62,000 people in HIV-affected areas. In 2012, Jena was invited by President Obama to pray for the nation in front of a TV audience of twenty million. She has been honored as an Epoch Award Winner, as <i>GOOD Magazine</i>'s GOOD 100, and as one of <i>Christianity Today</i>'s 33 under 33 Christian leaders shaping the next generation of faith.

Jena and her husband, James, and their son, Jude live in Nashville and East Africa.One Thousand Wells 1<p></p> Union Square<p></p> <br>My parents had experienced a thing or two in the world by the time I arrived. That might explain why security&#x2014;and fear&#x2014;were such a part of my early childhood.<br> <br>My father was the first American-born member of his Chinese immigrant family. Even though he lost his mother at age five, endured beatings from bullies in San Francisco&#x2019;s Panhandle, and weathered the abuse of a stepmother who refused to feed him, Dad made something of himself as a prosecutor who put bad guys in jail. My mother survived martini-mixing socialite parents from the Midwest and became a psychiatric nurse with compassion deeper than the bottomless drinks of her father.<br> <br>Mom and Dad fell in love on a blind date one San Francisco Christmas Eve and married soon after. They lost their first daughter to a congenital heart defect when she was eleven months old. As their next child, I was fiercely protected&#x2014;my parents set out to ensure that I would know little want, fear, or loss. When my brother arrived nearly three years later, their circle of protection enclosed him as well.<br> <br>We grew up with alarm systems in our home, emergency whistles on our backpacks, and lunch pails filled with food too healthy to be traded in the cafeteria. On the first day of kindergarten, my dad drove behind the school bus to make sure the driver made good use of turn signals. If my parents had occasion to fly, they took separate airplanes so that, should one plane go down, they would not orphan us as their parents metaphorically had.<br> <br>Restaurants were complicated for us. If the nonsmoking section smelled at all like the smoking section, we walked away. If the nonsmoking section passed the first test, Dad still wanted to sit facing the door.<br> <br>We had an earthquake plan, a fire plan, and a Y2K plan. &#x201c;Be prepared&#x201d; was our motto. And so I went to day care with a Cabbage Patch Kid in one hand and Caution in the other. I refused to risk slides on playgrounds, salt on my food, or the deep end of the swimming pool. I lived for rules, seat belts, and year-round SPF 50 sunscreen.<br> <br>My dad had logical reasons for all this protection: he made legal enemies through his work. My mom had research-based reasons: she knew the data; she knew about all possible threats to children. They both had intuitive reasons: the world had been a dangerous place thus far.<br> <br>.&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;.<br> <br>When I was nine, our family moved to Burlingame, a small suburb in the San Francisco Peninsula. Known for its affluence and Victorian neighborhoods, Burlingame hosted a Pottery Barn, United Colors of Benetton, and one of Starbucks&#x2019;s first non-Seattle shops.<br> <br>Our new house was tucked securely into the neighborhood cul-de-sac. Brick stairs lined with honeysuckle climbed from the street to our front door. A towering row of eucalyptus trees shaded the nearby boulevard of El Camino Real. My existence fit into a four-mile radius and was filled with all the right activities for a Bay Area third grader: piano lessons, ballet, T-ball, and Kumon, an after-school speed math program that was popular among Asian students. Burlingame, like my childhood, was beautiful, safe, and smelled like peppermint patties.<br> <br>At that point, it hadn&#x2019;t occurred to me that my life was privileged and protected. Our family lived and looked like our neighbors. I enjoyed riding my pink Huffy bike around the block, going to sleepovers, and watching Full House on Friday nights.<br> <br>But on a crowded San Francisco street, my world opened out.<br> <br>Mom and I were walking to a bistro near Union Square. People crowded the streets&#x2014;hurried men in suits, tourists in matching t-shirts with cameras around their necks, an old woman pulling a shopping bag on wheels. I treaded carefully on the gum-stained sidewalk, over grates and cigarette butts. Graffiti defaced the parking meters. Chinese characters embellished the awnings of restaurants. The air smelled like the concrete public bathroom we avoided at the farmers&#x2019; market on Saturdays.<br> <br>I felt small and uncertain.<br> <br>Then, walking up Geary Street, I saw him. He was a tall black man with sunken eyes, standing on the edge of the sidewalk. He balanced himself on the balls of his feet, calling out to passersby. Calling out to me.<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m hungry,&#x201d; he said.<br> <br>I looked around to see if anyone else was listening. The outside world scurried forward. My world stopped. I paused to listen to him. He sounded defeated, like something had broken him.<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m hungry,&#x201d; he repeated. His face was sad. It seemed that every person who ignored him hurt him more. I felt a pain in my body&#x2014;something wasn&#x2019;t right. Then Mom called from farther down the sidewalk, and I shuffled to join her.<br> <br>At lunch, my hamburger sat on my plate untouched. I fiddled with the paper wrapper of my straw. As a third grader, I had already learned a lot about the world. I had learned that pickles and cucumbers are the same thing and that the earth orbits the sun, not the other way around. I had learned that we have to say goodbye to friends sometimes and that Christmas presents can be disappointing. But it was inside that bistro, with a plate full of food, that I learned that there were people in the world whose lives were very different than mine.<br> <br>For a moment, I forgot that I was a shy, accommodating child. That hamburger didn&#x2019;t belong to me, and I knew it. Mom knew it, too, when I asked for a to-go box. I whispered a request to find the man.<br> <br>&#x201c;We can try,&#x201d; she whispered back.<br> <br>We traced our steps from the restaurant to the parked car, my patent-leather shoes tapping along the sidewalks. He won&#x2019;t be hungry anymore, I thought. He&#x2019;ll know I heard him.<br> <br>We arrived at the block where the man had stood, but he was no longer there. The streets were less crowded, and the summer sun was creeping its way behind the cityscape. It hadn&#x2019;t occurred to me that he wouldn&#x2019;t be there. I had his hamburger, after all.<br> <br>Mom and I walked a few more blocks, circling Union Square in search of him, but we both knew he was gone.<br> <br>Mom&#x2019;s caution was rising as the sun sank.<br> <br>&#x201c;We need to go home, sweetie,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s not safe for us to be here.&#x201d;<br> <br>The Styrofoam container I held suddenly felt heavy with disappointment. Not just disappointment that we couldn&#x2019;t find the man, but disappointment that streets existed where grown-ups could walk by a hungry man&#x2019;s pleas for help. In my child&#x2019;s mind I wondered: What did they believe that made them capable of ignoring a person in need? Did they think this man deserved to be hungry? Did they feel they had permission to walk past him?<br> <br>As I stood silently on Geary Street with a hamburger in my hands, I knew that what happened to that man on the street was wrong. I knew that no human being deserves to be hungry or ignored or forgotten. Though I could not express it at the time, I knew that every person is worthy of dignity&#x2014;no matter what.<br> <br>.&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;.<br> <br>What is it about childhood perception that makes us able to see right and wrong for what they are? What is it that makes such awareness slippery in our adult minds?<br> <br>Since that San Francisco day, I have seen a thousand wrongs in this world: Mothers with no option but to give their children dirty water. Men abusing power. Death so common in a community that funerals are held nearly every weekend. But I see through worldly eyes.<br> <br>When I try to see Kenya or my Nashville neighborhood as I saw the streets of San Francisco as a child, experience gets in the way. The wrongs in this world do not hurt me the way they did once. The injustices don&#x2019;t seem as shattering. But whether or not I feel the ache that I knew as a child, I want to act on those young convictions.<br> <br>Because if we believe that we are not better than a hungry man on the sidewalk, if we believe that the death of someone else&#x2019;s child is not different than the death of our own, if we believe that sensitivity to injustice is imperative, then we should be outraged when we look at the world. Our outrage doesn&#x2019;t need to lead to helplessness or, worse, cynicism. It can be the impetus that opens the world out.<br> <br>I never found the man whose voice called to me, whose eyes chase me down the alleyway of my memory.<br> <br>In more ways than I can count, I am still looking for him.</p><h2>About Paterson;: The making and unmaking of an American city</h2><p>Book by Norwood, Christopher</p><p></p><h2>Gretchen: A Thriller</h2><p><p><b>&#x201c;...[A] brilliantly constructed novel...Kirk draws the reader into a fascinating world of shifting truths whose details are by turns grotesque, funny, creepy, thoughtful, and exhilarating.&#x201d; &#x2014;<i>Publishers Weekly</i> (starred review)</b></p><p><b>The new tenants have a terrible secret.

And when he did, his remarks were mostly indifferent and often hostile. But his leading ladies greatly enriched his films, even as many of them achieved international stardom precisely because of their work for Hitchcock&#x2014;among the dozens of women were Madeleine Carroll, Joan Fontaine, Grace Kelly and Tippi Hedren. Yet he maintained a stony, insistent silence about the quality of their performances and their contributions to his art. <br><br><i>Spellbound by Beauty</i>&#x2014;the final volume in master biographer Donald Spoto&#x2019;s Hitchcock trilogy that began with <i>The Art of Alfred Hitchcock</i> and continued with <i>The Dark Side of Genius: The Life of Alfred Hitchcock</i>&#x2014;is the fascinating, complex and finally tragic story of the great moviemaker and his female stars, the unusual ideas of sex and romance that inform his films and the Hollywood dreams that often became nightmares. <br><br>Rich with fresh revelations based on previously undisclosed tapes, new interviews, private correspondence and personal papers made available only to the author, this thoughtful, compassionate yet explosive portrait details Hitchcock&#x2019;s outbursts of cruelty, the shocking humor and the odd amalgam of adoration and contempt that time and again characterized Hitchcock&#x2019;s obsessive relationships with women&#x2014;and that also, paradoxically, fed his genius.<br><br>He insisted, for example, that Madeleine Carroll submit herself to painful physical demands during the making of The 39 Steps. He harbored a poignantly unrequited love for Ingrid Bergman. He meticulously and deliberately constructed Grace Kelly&#x2019;s image. Finally, he stalked, harassed and abused Tippi Hedren. His treatment of his daughter, Pat, was certainly unusual, while his strange marriage to his sometime collaborator Alma Reville was a union that (according to Hitchcock himself) was forever chaste after one incident. <br><br><i>Spellbound by Beauty</i> offers important insights into the life of a brilliant, powerful, eccentric and tortured artist, and it corrects a major gap in movie history by paying tribute at last to those extraordinarily talented actresses who gave so much to his films.</p><p>DONALD SPOTO is the author of <i>The Art of Alfred Hitchcock</i> and <i>The Dark Side of Genius: The Life of Alfred Hitchcock</i>. His other bestselling biographies include the lives of Audrey Hepburn, Ingrid Bergman, Marlene Dietrich, and most recently Grace Kelly.<i><br></i>Chapter One&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>Love in Handcuffs (1920-1926)&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>For five years beginning in 1920, when he was twenty-one, Alfred Hitchcock worked in London for Famous Players-Lasky, the British production branch of Hollywood's Paramount Pictures. Most of the senior technical staff were Americans, imported to work on the two small stages, once a power station in the borough of Islington.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>Hitchcock's first job, illustrating the title cards of silent movies, gave him access to various jobs on an ad hoc basis: designer for this picture, or art director, co-writer or production manager for that one. Unlike the job specialization in the American movie industry, laborers hired by English studios were encouraged to perform multiple tasks, working wher-ever their talents could be exploited-hence the multitalented young Hitchcock became a jack-of-all-work on at least eighteen British silent movies. "All my early training was by Americans," he said years later, "and it was far superior to the British."&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>In 1923, he was still putting in long hours and learning new, up-to-date production methods. That year, producer Michael Balcon took over the studio when Paramount withdrew; Balcon's goal was to sponsor entertainment for an international (especially an American) audience. Accordingly, Balcon had brought over Hollywood's Betty Compson to star in a picture called Woman to Woman, on which Hitchcock worked, as he said, as "general factotum. I wrote the script. I designed the sets, and I managed the production. It was the first film that I had really got my hands onto."<br><br>It was also the first of five films on which he worked for the studio's leading director, Graham Cutts, with whom he had an increasingly hostile relationship. The trouble was caused by Cutts's indiscreet extramarital liaisons, which Hitchcock considered unprofessional, as they invariably necessitated rearrangement of the production schedule. Additionally, Hitchcock may have envied Cutts his easy way with the ladies; in any case, he certainly wanted to supplant Cutts and to secure additional credits, the better to impress Balcon. "I was quite dogmatic," he said. "I would build a set and say to the director, 'Here's where it's shot from!' "&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>Cutts resented Hitchcock's assertive style and said so, but Balcon was impressed with the younger man's talent and drive-especially after Cutts returned to London in early 1925, after filming The Blackguard in Berlin. While in Germany, Hitchcock had expeditiously resolved many logistical problems caused by Cutts's ineffective balancing act of work, wife and women on the side. Soon after, Balcon asked Hitchcock to direct a motion picture.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>"I had no intention of becoming a film director," Hitchcock always said of this time in his career. "I was very happy doing the scripts and the art direction. I hadn't thought of myself as a director"-which was evidently not the case. Working on productions six days weekly for almost five years, he was clearly keen for promotion: he was writing scripts, designing sets, working with editors, and was, to his chagrin, paid miserably in comparison with established directors. Eager to perform any task on a picture by dispatching quickly and effectively every challenging aspect of production, Hitchcock indeed, according to Balcon, "wanted to be a director, but it was not easy to get a young man launched in so important a job," because financiers and distributors were wary of promoting an assistant.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>And so Balcon turned to his foreign partners: "I had to arrange to have [Hitchcock direct his first two pictures] in Germany because of the resistance to his becoming a director" in London. With the screenwriter Eliot Stannard, the assistant director Alma Reville, and the cinematographer Gaetano di Ventimiglia, Hitchcock headed for exterior location shooting in northern Italy and then for studio work in Munich, where they were joined by a crew of international technicians and co-producers. Hitchcock absorbed enough rudimentary German to communicate his wishes.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>His assignment was The Pleasure Garden, based on an unexceptional but once popular novel about two London showgirls, their shifting fidelities to the difficult men in their lives, and their dangerous sojourn in the tropics-all of it wrapped up in a d�nouement of madness and murder. The principal characters were portrayed by American stars acting in Germany and Italy as if the settings were London and the Far East. Hitchcock had the task of making all this appear realistic and emotionally credible, and for the most part, he succeeded admirably.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>Balcon imported a pair of Hollywood's top glamour girls, Virginia Valli and Carmelita Geraghty. Virginia had already appeared in forty-seven pictures under the direction of John Ford, King Vidor and others. She wanted to hear what Hitchcock planned and how she would look in the finished film. Carmelita had equivalent concerns.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>"I was in a cold sweat," Hitchcock admitted later. "I wanted to disguise the fact that this was my first directorial effort. I dreaded to think what [Virginia Valli], an established Hollywood star, would say if she discovered that she had been brought all the way over to Europe to be directed by a beginner. I was terrified at giving her instructions. I've no idea how many times I asked my future wife [Alma Reville] if I was doing the right thing. She, sweet soul, gave me courage by swearing I was doing marvelously."&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>So began a historic collaboration. Alma Reville had a keen eye, she knew how stories should be structured and rendered visually, she had worked as an editor and she was not hesitant to tell Hitchcock just what she thought. Tiny and titian-haired, she gave a first impression of shy gentility, but the real Alma Reville was an acutely intelligent, self-assured woman of steely resolve, quite different from the insecure Hitchcock, who was ever self-conscious about his appearance, his tastes and his modest Cockney background. Whenever a tough decision had to be made in business or private life, Alma acted fearlessly.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>Hitchcock admitted his fears, which were linked to a childhood sense of insecurity. "Fear? It has influenced my life and my career, and I've known it since my childhood. I remember when I was five or six. It was a Sunday evening, the only time my parents did not have to work. They put me to bed and went to Hyde Park for a stroll"-then a ninety-minute tram and train ride from the Hitchcock home. "They were sure I would be asleep until their return. But I woke up, called out, and no one answered. Nothing but night all around me. Shaking, I got up, wandered around the empty, dark house and, finally arriving in the kitchen, found a piece of cold meat which I ate while drying my tears."<br><br>Hitchcock was uncomfortable around his two American stars, but he knew how much he needed them. He also resented their enormous salaries, and his budget forestalled their expectations of the kind of Hollywood-style luxury they had there. "Valli was big stuff and knew it," according to Hitchcock. "She expected a brass band. She expected the red carpet. But she didn't get them. Valli was peeved, but she turned out to be sweet enough."&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>Filming began in June 1925 in northern Italy, before moving to the studio interiors in Munich, which were suffocatingly hot that summer, for the ceilings were glass and air-conditioning was unknown. Everything seemed to go wrong: there were numerous delays from uncooperative extra players, and then a trained dog simply wandered off and his replacement insistently licked off the makeup applied to him to replicate his predecessor. After that, a woman hired to play a native girl arrived on the day of her swimming scene and promptly announced that her monthly period would prevent her going into the water.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>This bit of news, Hitchcock claimed, was an educational experience for him. He insisted that he had never heard of the menstrual cycle because it had not been included in his schoolboy education-nor, one might add, had production design or scriptwriting. But like his assertion that he had no thought of becoming a director, this statement of ignorance simply cannot be taken at face value. He was twenty-six, had an older sister and brother, certainly must have noticed discreet advertisements for feminine hygiene products and had worked at a movie studio during the freewheeling 1920s-not generally a place and time of polite discourse. Sexually inexperienced though he claims to have been, he was not a backward, preadolescent country boy from an earlier century. Ordinary curiosity surely must have supplemented his formal education.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>But word circulated that Hitchcock was an unsophisticated innocent, which (as he may have intended) evoked the benignly maternal, protective reactions of Valli and Geraghty and much improved both the tone of the production and their pliancy in his hands. Thus, he won them over not by exhibiting his sophistication, but by feigning ignorance. He employed, in other words, whatever it took to achieve the desired effect-including his demand that Virginia Valli wear a blond wig for her role.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>When Balcon arrived in Munich to have a look at Hitchcock's first cut of the picture, he agreed with the director that rearrangements were called for, but for marketing purposes, he also said he liked the American look of the picture. The Pleasure Garden revealed, too, Hitchcock's skillful use of hallucinatory cinematic techniques (dissolves and double printing, for example)-and, for commercial appeal, the emphasis on fast-paced action alternating with scenes of violence and boudoir sex.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>The final form of The Pleasure Garden contains several elements that would intrigue Hitchcock throughout his career: the theatrical setting (which recurs in The Ring, Murder!, The 39 Steps, Sabotage, Young and Innocent, Saboteur, Stage Fright, North by Northwest and Torn Curtain); the motif of voyeurism (especially in Rear Window and Psycho); the experience of emotional breakdown (in, for example, Shadow of a Doubt, Spellbound, Under Capricorn, Stage Fright, the remake of The Man Who Knew Too Much, The Wrong Man, Vertigo, Psycho, The Birds and Marnie); and the psychological torture and physical pain inflicted on women by violent men (which runs from Blackmail through Family Plot). The last element is not peculiar to Hitchcock's entertainments, of course: the damsel in distress is virtually an ancient archetype, long a staple of literature, poetry, theater, opera and movies. But Hitchcock showed the world, in stark closeup, that misogyny was part of a pandemic social pathology. He was neither moralist nor preacher, but his work consistently reveals that the fine arts of human exploitation and cruelty are symptoms of a deep fissure in the human spirit.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>The Pleasure Garden opens with a close shot of women's legs, hastening down a spiral staircase toward the stage of the eponymous theater, where the women dance with wild abandon typical of the Jazz Age; the movement is so animated that this silent film suddenly becomes a kind of vivid flipbook. Hitchcock then shows the men in the audience, formally dressed and leering as they gaze at the dancers through their opera glasses. These will become mainstream themes and images for Hitchcock-characters in the world of make-believe drawn into bizarre real-life dramas; voyeurism; the camera observing an observer; the rapid transitions from the watcher to the watched; the dizzying staircase-and mischievous humor. "What every chorus girl knows," announces a title card-and the movie then shows a woman washing her stockings in a basin. Hitchcock's bedroom scenes occur later in the movie, and there is nothing coy, bashful or boyish about them.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>Life within and outside this pleasure garden, from London's Piccadilly to the tropics, is a perilous paradise-thus the ominous snake entwined around a tree on the title card designs Hitchcock devised, adding another layer of meaning to the film's title. The chase and nick-of-time rescue at the finale reveal his familiarity with filmmakers such as D. W. Griffith, and Hitchcock was certainly inspired by Charles Chaplin and Buster Keaton as much as by Germans such as F. W. Murnau and Fritz Lang, whom he had met in Berlin. One stylistic conceit particularly marked the Hitchcock style from 1925 forward: characters often gaze directly at the camera, thus making the audience a corresponding player, a participant in the drama.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>Hitchcock boldly added his initials (and sometimes his full signature) to the intertitle designs. In this regard, he was again taking a page from Chaplin and Griffith, who were among the first to understand that the marketing of their own names was as critical as the selling of the properties or presenting an attractive leading lady. "Actors come and go," Hitchcock told his colleagues at London's Film Society that year, "but the name of the director should stay clearly in the mind of the audiences." That attitude led to his cameo appearances in his films: he became the artist signing his canvas, reminding viewers that this was an Alfred J. Hitchcock production.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>When Balcon screened The Pleasure Garden in London for the press, journalists were enthusiastic-"a powerful and interesting story [that] promises well for Hitchcock's future efforts," proclaimed the trade journal Bioscope on March 25, 1926. But the financiers working with Balcon would not distribute the picture, claiming that its content and style would alienate British audiences accustomed to more straightforward and less visually inventive movies. Hence Balcon decided to shelve The Pleasure Garden for a while-but he had not lost faith in Hitchcock, to whom he gave another crack at directing. (Later, American journalists were scathing, calling the picture "sappy" and "a Wiener schnitzel," and banishing it straightaway.)&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>As for Virginia Valli and Carmelita Geraghty, they apparently never spoke on the record about Hitchcock, even after his international fame was secure. That was perhaps due to the dramatic changes in their lives, which led them to reject all later requests for interviews about their days as movie stars. Carmelita worked in an additional fifty-three pictures during the next decade, but then, at thirty-four, she retired and became a successful professional artist whose paintings were sold at galleries across America; she died in 1966.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>Virginia turned her back on Hollywood after appearing in eighteen more movies. Real-life romance replaced the imaginary sort when she met the dashing actor Charles Farrell, whom she married in 1931, when she was thirty-three. For the next thirty-seven years, until her death in 1968, she lived more happily than any heroine she portrayed. For her as for Carmelita, glamour-girl vanity was no longer important.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>On his side, Hitchcock referred to his first leading ladies only to cite the costs of their excess personal baggage and their refusal to eat the food served on European trains.</p><h2>The Origins of El Greco: Icon Painting in Venetian Crete</h2><p>The Origins of El Greco focuses on the evolution of the multifaceted relationship of Cretan painters with Western art during this rich period. The icon painters in the workshops on Crete in the 15th and 16th centuries-the setting in which El Greco was trained-were renowned for their skill in painting impeccable panels not only in the traditional Byzantine manner but also in a style inspired by Western models. The Origins of El Greco presents an extraordinary group of 15th and 16th century paintings, including works by El Greco. The color-illustrated catalogue features detailed descriptions of all 46 masterpieces included in the exhibition, some of them published for the first time, as well as 3 informative essays: Anastasia Drandaki, Curator, Byzantine Collection, Benaki Museum, Athens writes on &#34;Between Byzantium and Venice: Icon Painting in Venetian Crete in the Fifteenth and Sixteenth Centuries&#34;, Olga Gratziou, Professor of Byzantine Art and Archaeology, University of Crete writes on &#34;Cretan Architecture and Sculpture in the Venetian Period&#34; and Nicos Hadjinicolaou, Professor Emeritus in Art History, University of Crete, and Honorary Fellow of the Institute for Mediterranean Studies, writes on &#34;Early and Late El Greco&#34;.</p><p></p><h2>In the American Grain: Arthur Dove, Marsden Hartley, John Marin, Georgia O&#39;Keeffe, and Alfred Stieglitz : The Stieglitz Circle at the Phillips Collection</h2><p>During the 1920s and 1930s, Alfred Stieglitz's stylish New York galleries were a mecca to artistic innovators and avant garde thinkers, those struggling to cast off the burden of American puritanical thought and the fixed idea among the intellectual elite that important art, art that was real and would last, was being made only in Europe.<br>At the same time Duncan Phillips, a determined art collector and heir to a steel fortune, opened two rooms of his Washington, D.C., home to begin a museum of modern art. Although he collected some of the world's masterpieces, especially French Impressionism, he kept a diligent eye on the work being done in his own country.<br>That Stieglitz and Phillips would meet was destiny. Their long friendship, sometimes an uneasy alliance, brought forth a reevaluation of art in American culture. Their combined vision and resources invigorated a movement and prepared the way for public acceptance of American modernism.<br>The uniquely American style of the artists in the Stieglitz circle - Arthur Dove, Marsden Hartley, John Marin, and Georgia O'Keeffe - defied European tradition and opened the door for artistic experimentation. In the American Grain gathers the Stieglitz circle as acquired by Phillips: paintings by all four artists, watercolors by Dove and Marin, assemblages by Dove, and Stieglitz's "Equivalents," his acclaimed photographs of clouds and sky. The bold, original style of the works included here stand together to signal a shift in the development of art - its coming of age in America.</p><p>Alfred Stieglitz exhibited, defended, and promoted the most revolutionary artists he could find, especially the four painters showcased in this volume: Arthur Dove, John Marin, Marsden Hartley, and Georgia O'Keeffe. Their work, along with Stieglitz's own stunning cloud photographs, is at the core of the famous Phillips Collection housed in Washington, D.C. Duncan Phillips, an intrepid collector, forged a complicated alliance with Stieglitz, one that survived serious conflicts and led to the creation of the first modern art museum in the country. Both Stieglitz and Phillips were avid about art that was genuinely American in its spirit, innovation, and connection to the land. All five artists meet and exceed these criteria as they merge mindscape and landscape. Dove tops the list both in number of works and in the daring of his organic yet mystical compositions. Marin's translucent yet energetic watercolors stand in strong contrast to Hartley's saturated, heavily worked oils; O'Keeffe contributes a distilled sensuality; and Stieglitz captures the abstract beauty of sky and cloud. Curator Turner has chosen well both in terms of colorplates and text, which contains a lively history of Phillips' collecting venture. <i>Donna Seaman</i></p><h2>Do Not Ask What Good We Do: Inside the U.S. House of Representatives</h2><p>The U.S. House of Representatives&#x2014;a large, often unruly body of men and women elected every other year from 435 distinct microcosms of America&#x2014;has achieved renown as &#x201c;the people&#x2019;s House,&#x201d; the world&#x2019;s most democratic institution, and an acute Rorschach of biennial public passions. In the midterm election year 2010, recession-battered Americans expressed their discontent with a simultaneously overreaching and underperforming government by turning the formerly Democratically controlled House over to the Republicans. Among the new GOP majority were eighty-seven freshmen, many of them political novices with Tea Party backing who pledged a more open, responsive, and fiscally thrifty House. What the 112th Congress instead achieved was a public standing so low&#x2014;a ghastly 9 percent approval rating&#x2014; that, as its longest-serving member, John Dingell, would dryly remark, &#x201c;I think pedophiles would do better.&#x201d; What happened? <br><br>Robert Draper explores this question just as he examined the Bush White House in his 2007 <i>New York Times </i>bestselling book <i>Dead Certain: The Presidency of George W. Bush</i>&#x2014;by burrowing deeply inside the subject, gaining cooperation of the major players, and producing a colorful, unsparingly detailed, but evenhanded narrative of how the House of Representatives became a house of ill repute. Draper&#x2019;s cast of characters spans the full spectrum of political experience and ideologies&#x2014;from the Democrat Dingell, a congressman since 1955 (though elbowed out of power by the party&#x2019;s House leader, Nancy Pelosi), to Allen West, a black Republican Tea Party sensation, former Army lieutenant colonel, and political neophyte with a talent for equal opportunity offending. While unspooling the boisterous, at times tragic, and ultimately infuriating story of the 112th Congress, Draper provides unforgettable portraits of Gabrielle Giffords, the earnest young Arizona congresswoman who was gunned down by a madman at the beginning of the legislative session; Anthony Weiner, the Democrats&#x2019; clown prince and self-made media star until the New Yorker self-immolated in a sex scandal; the strong-willed Pelosi and her beleaguered if phlegmatic Republican counterpart, House Speaker John Boehner; the affable majority whip, Kevin McCarthy, tasked with instilling team spirit in the iconoclastic freshmen; and most of all, the previously unknown new members who succeeded in shoving Boehner&#x2019;s Republican Conference to the far right and thereby bringing the nation, more than once, to the brink of governmental shutdown or economic default. <br><br>In this lively work of political narrative, Draper synthesizes some of the most talked-about breaking news of the day with the real story of what happened behind the scenes. This book is a timely and masterfully told parable of dysfunction that may well serve as Exhibit A of how Americans lost faith in their democratic institutions. <br><br>*** <br><br><b><i>&#x201c;Congress will rise June 1st, as most of us expect.

The venue was the Caucus Room, an expense-account steakhouse halfway between the White House and the Capitol. A seething winter chill was the least of their discomforts that evening. Nearly a half-million people had begun to congregate on the National Mall on Sunday, January 18, 2009&#x2014;two days before the inauguration. By the time Obama was sworn in on Tuesday, the number had reached 1.8 million. The nation&#x2019;s capital had never hosted a crowd that large, not for any reason. Definitely not for the previous president, George W. Bush, who had been jeered that afternoon as a helicopter whisked him off to Texas. Now the occupant of the White House was a Democrat. The House and Senate were controlled by Democrats. Barricades still lined the streets outside, as if at any moment the ruling party might engulf the Caucus Room and finish off what was left of the Republicans. <br> <br>On such a night, it was a comfort to suffer among friends. Most of them&#x2014;Eric Cantor, Kevin McCarthy, Paul Ryan, Pete Sessions, Jeb Hensarling, Pete Hoekstra, and Dan Lungren&#x2014;were members of the U.S. House of Representatives. Five served in the Senate: Jim DeMint, Jon Kyl, Tom Coburn, John Ensign, and Bob Corker. The other three invitees were conservative journalist Fred Barnes of the Weekly Standard, former House Speaker (and future presidential candidate) Newt Gingrich, and communications specialist Frank Luntz. Most of them had attended the inauguration. That astounding vista of humanity on the Mall would haunt them more than last November&#x2019;s electoral margins. McCarthy, a California congressman who had thus far served only a single term in the House, had made a game effort of viewing the event for the historic moment it was. He&#x2019;d procured Obama&#x2019;s autograph and even that of Obama&#x2019;s sister. As the unworldly progeny of the Bakersfield working class, Kevin McCarthy had been dazzled to be included in such a tableau. As a Republican, he and the others in the room were devastated. <br> <br>Luntz had organized the dinner&#x2014;telling the invitees, &#x201c;You&#x2019;ll have nothing to do that night, and right now we don&#x2019;t matter anyway, so let&#x2019;s all be irrelevant together.&#x201d; He had selected these men because they were among the Republican Party&#x2019;s most energetic thinkers&#x2014;and because they all got along with Luntz, who could be difficult. Three times during the 2008 election cycle, Sean Hannity had thrown him off the set at Fox Studios. The top Republican in the House, Minority Leader John Boehner, had nurtured a dislike of Luntz for more than a decade. No one had to ask why Boehner wasn&#x2019;t at the Caucus Room that evening. <br> <br>The dinner tables were set up in a square, at Luntz&#x2019;s request, so that everyone could see each other and talk freely. He asked that Gingrich speak first. It was Newt, after all, who had pulled the Republicans out of a far deeper hole fourteen years ago, leading the GOP to a takeover of the House for the first time since 1955. <br> <br>Gingrich was happy to oblige. Obama&#x2019;s inaugural speech was impressive, the former Speaker said. The evocations of constitutional principles, pragmatism, and risk-taking&#x2014;&#x201c;those could have been our words.&#x201d; Someone ought to laminate Obama&#x2019;s speech and disseminate it, the better to hold the president accountable to his pledges. <br> <br>Being competitors, however, they did not dwell on Obama&#x2019;s seeming invincibility. They&#x2019;d been thrashed, it was roundly agreed, because they had it coming. They ended up chucking their own principles and standing for nothing. They&#x2019;d spent the last eight years defending policies they never should have signed on to in the first place. They&#x2019;d lost their way. <br> <br>&#x201c;We got obsessed with governing,&#x201d; Ensign said&#x2014;adding with distaste, &#x201c;making sure the trains run on time. Well, what if the train is heading towards the cliff?&#x201d; <br> <br>They picked at their salads and drank their wine and tried not to think about the thousands now dancing at the ten inaugural balls that the new president and his wife would be attending before the night was through. <br> <br>Luntz was secretly overjoyed. When had Republicans in a group setting ever acknowledged how badly they had blown it? When had they ever recognized that they had become part of the problem rather than the solution? Maybe they don&#x2019;t see how big this is, he thought. <br> <br>&#x201c;So we&#x2019;re in the depths,&#x201d; said Pete Hoekstra, who as a freshman in January 1993 had attended Bill Clinton&#x2019;s swearing-in and had seen the GOP survive that particular downer. &#x201c;The discussion we&#x2019;re having tonight about President Obama, and where our party is, is no different than the discussion I came into as a freshman&#x2014;except that it was even worse.&#x201d; <br> <br>Laughing, Hoekstra reminded them, &#x201c;We&#x2019;d been a minority party for forty years! And two short years later&#x201d;&#x2014;Hoekstra gestured to Gingrich, the field general of the 1994 revolution&#x2014;&#x201c;it&#x2019;s a whole new world.&#x201d; <br> <br>How to regain that whole new world&#x2014;that was now the question. <br> <br>The men in the room were, behaviorally speaking, Washingtonians. Unlike ordinary Americans, they lived by a biennial calendar, the rhythms of their lives propelled by the electoral cycle as insistently as the migratory and mating habits of winged creatures. What their party had done from 1994 to 2000, and what the Democrats had then done from 2006 to 2008, the Republicans would once again do. They would take back the House in November 2010. They would use the House as the Republicans&#x2019; spear point to mortally wound President Obama in 2011. Then they would retake the White House and the Senate in 2012. <br> <br>They would do all this, but only if the American voter blessed them to do so. <br> <br>It made no sense, they all agreed, to attack Obama personally. The man was too popular. <br> <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s got to be about ideas,&#x201d; said Eric Cantor, the House minority whip, in his honeyed Virginia drawl. The Democrats now controlled everything and were already, with a monstrously priced economic stimulus package, showing their true colors. Give them time&#x2014;they would screw things up, just as the GOP had. <br> <br>&#x201c;But everyone&#x2019;s got to stick together,&#x201d; said Paul Ryan, a thirty-eight-year-old Wisconsin congressman and numbers fetishist whose shiny earnestness recalled an Ozzie and Harriet America. Ryan hated squabbling amongst conservatives&#x2014;the paleos versus the neos, the socials against the moderates, on and on for as long as he&#x2019;d been on the Hill, which was all of his adult life. Ryan had long sought to be the GOP&#x2019;s glue, pleading for adherence to the principles and the data. At times he looked like the underfed, hollow-eyed child of alcoholic parents. <br> <br>&#x201c;The only way we&#x2019;ll succeed is if we&#x2019;re united,&#x201d; Ryan told the others. &#x201c;If we tear ourselves apart, we&#x2019;re finished.&#x201d; But, he added, he liked what he was hearing now. Everyone at the table sounded like a genuine conservative. It was a place to start. <br> <br>&#x201c;If you act like you&#x2019;re the minority, you&#x2019;re going to stay in the minority,&#x201d; said Kevin McCarthy. &#x201c;We&#x2019;ve gotta challenge them on every single bill and challenge them on every single campaign.&#x201d; <br> <br>Luntz viewed McCarthy as one of the Republican Party&#x2019;s emerging stars: an easygoing, unthreatening guy who understood that language and appearance mattered at least as much as substance. Nonetheless, the pollster and media guru interjected a cautionary note. &#x201c;One of the worst political performances I&#x2019;ve ever seen,&#x201d; he said, &#x201c;was when the Democrats took over the House in 2007 and Nancy Pelosi shut out the Republicans. And everybody whined about it. If any of you behave that way, I&#x2019;ll go on TV and hold you accountable! If you&#x2019;re whiners, you&#x2019;re losers!&#x201d; <br> <br>Luntz tended to get carried away, but everyone knew he had a point. <br> <br>Senator Jon Kyl began to focus on immediate tactics. He pointed out that Tim Geithner, Obama&#x2019;s nominee to be secretary of the Treasury, had failed to pay his Social Security and Medicare taxes during his three-year employment at the International Monetary Fund. Kyl sat on the Senate Finance Committee, which would be conducting Geithner&#x2019;s confirmation hearings the next morning. The Arizona senator intended to go after the nominee. &#x201c;I&#x2019;d like to hear your thoughts on the approach I should take,&#x201d; he said to the others. <br> <br>There was a pattern here, Gingrich pointed out. Charlie Rangel, the new House Ways and Means chairman, hadn&#x2019;t paid taxes on his rental property income in more than two decades. Rangel and Geithner would be wielding more power over how taxpayer dollars would be spent than anyone else in America&#x2014;and yet these guys couldn&#x2019;t even be trusted to pay their own taxes? <br> <br>&#x201c;And there&#x2019;s a web,&#x201d; chimed in McCarthy. &#x201c;There are freshmen who accepted campaign money from Rangel. They&#x2019;re caught in the web.&#x201d; McCarthy suggested that they waste no time smacking the new Democrats with attack ads. <br> <br>The dinner lasted nearly four hours. They parted company almost giddily. The Republicans had agreed on a way forward: <br> <br>...</p><h2>Final Matters: Selected Poems, 2004-2010 (The Lockert Library of Poetry in Translation, 136)</h2><p><p><b>An award-winning translator presents selections from the haunting final volumes of a leading voice in contemporary Hungarian poetry</b></p><p>Szil�rd Borb�ly, one of the most celebrated writers to emerge from post-Communist Hungary, received numerous literary awards in his native country. In this volume, acclaimed translator Ottilie Mulzet reveals the full range and force of Borb�ly&#x2019;s verse by bringing together generous selections from his last two books, <i>Final Matters</i> and <i>To the Body</i>. The original Hungarian text is set on pages facing the English translations, and the book also features an afterword by Mulzet that places the poems in literary, historical, and biographical context.</p><p>Restless, curious, learned, and alert, Borb�ly weaves into his work an unlikely mix of Hungarian folk songs, Christian and Jewish hymns, classical myths, police reports, and unsettling accounts of abortions. In her afterword, Mulzet calls this collection &#x201c;a blasphemous and fragmentary prayer book ... that challenges us to rethink the boundaries of victimhood, culpability, and our own religious and cultural definitions.&#x201d;</p></p><p><b>Szil�rd Borb�ly </b>(1963&#x2013;2014) wrote in a wide variety of genres.

It examines in detail the doctrines and practices which surround that holy building, and their implications for the individual Church member. Part one offers the Lord&#39;s invitation: &#34;Come to the temple.&#34; It sets forth the requirements for attendance: preparation through worthiness, and the attitude and behavior appropriate for those attending that holy place on the first and all subsequent occasions. Part two deals with the ancient temples then turns to the central human figure in the work of the temple- Elijah the Prophet, who anciently held the keys relative to the sealing power of the priesthood. Malachi&#39;s prophecy and the human tradition about Elijah&#39;s return in the latter days are impressively set forth. Elijah&#39;s return and all that it means for the happiness and salvation of mankind are the themes of parts three and four. Following early Restoration scenes, here is the Kirtland Temple built at great personal sacrifice. Dedicated, it fulfills a major purpose in the glorious visions of April 3, 1836, the Savior himself introducing three heavenly beings who then convey priesthood keys. One of these is Elijah. Thereafter the revelations progressively develop the doctrine of temple work for both the living and the dead; under divine direction temple ceremonies are introduced and participants flock to the Nauvoo Temple; through President Wilford Woodruff the supporting work of lineage linking is clarified by revelation; and the spirit of Elijah is manifest both in and out of the Church as genealogical research and temple work blossom, temples multiply, and those beyond the veil assist those involved in the work here. The endowment with its sacred covenants and its symbolic instruction, the sealing ordinance, and other temple ceremonies are discussed sensitively and authoritatively. Written direct to the reader, this is an outstanding book on a subject crucial to every child of God.</p><p></p><h2>Meet Cecile (American Girl Collection, 2)</h2><p>Cecile Rey can&#39;t wait for Mardi Gras--New Orleans&#39; dazzling season of parties and costume balls.

As they did in <i>This Is the Pumpkin </i>(1997) and <i>This Is the Turkey </i>(2003), Levine and Billin-Frye use simple, rhyming couplets and brightly colored, full-page illustrations to demonstrate how one family celebrates a holiday. Preparations for Hanukkah are underway. Max finds the dreidel, polishes the menorah, and helps his younger sister select candles as Mom prepares food, and everyone recites the blessings and lights the candles. The family exchanges presents and then welcomes other relatives, who enjoy eating latkes, playing games, singing songs, and listening to stories. As the holiday ends, Max returns his dreidel to the drawer to await next year's festivities. Although the verses do not cumulate as they do in "This Is the House That Jack Built," the meter follows a similar form and will appeal to children. The artwork has a cozy feel and is large enough for story hour sharing. A welcome addition to the holiday shelf. Glossary appended. <i>Kay Weisman</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

In The Oil Has Not Run Dry, Baum shares recollections about his lifelong commitment to theology, his atypical views, and his evolving understanding of the Catholic Church?s message. Baum reflects on his groundbreaking work with the Second Vatican Council (1962-65) and how it helped to open the Church to a new understanding of outsiders - one that advocated cooperation with world religions in support of peace and justice and respected secular philosophies committed to truth and social solidarity. Later embracing Latin American liberation theology, he became a leading thinker of the Catholic Left in Canada, adopting radical positions that initially earned support from Canadian bishops in the 1970s. Diverging from official Catholic doctrines regarding women and sexual ethics, Baum eventually left the priesthood, but continued to teach theology and remained active in the Church. The Oil Has Not Run Dry also discusses the contrast between Catholicism in Quebec and English-speaking North America, and the ways in which Baum sees Quebec&#39;s culture as more marked by social solidarity. This significant difference has inspired his own writings, which present the original development of Catholic thought in Quebec to an English-speaking readership.</p><p>Gregory Baum (1923-2017) was professor emeritus in the Faculty of Religious Studies at McGill University and the author of Fernand Dumont: A Sociologist Turns to Theology and Truth and Relevance: Catholic Theology in French Quebec since the Quiet Revoluti?The Oil Has Not Run Dry is a ?book of blessings? because of the thoroughness with which its author diagnoses the greater intellectual perils and social ills of our age and the compassion with which he dispenses remedial thinking and acting.?

This book appeals to people interested in nature, history, canoeing, women&#39;s issues, inspiration, and of course, Algonquin Provincial Park.</p><p>That evening, as I took some time to relax and contemplate, I had an almost mystical experience. Gazing out at the expanse of water and the forested hills, a sense of destiny seemed to envelop me. This was where I belonged. This was where I wanted to be for as long and as often as I could. I did not know how this might happen; I just knew that for me Algonquin Park was a lifelong commitment.Esther is a remarkable woman and this is a remarkable story. It's part love story, part history lesson, part wilderness guide. Finally, the wonderful and heart-warming stories of this Algonquin legend can be shared by all of us. There's something for everyone in this collection. -- <i>Scott Simmie, feature writer, Toronto Star</i></p><h2>The Arabian Nights (Everyman&#39;s Library)</h2><p>(Book Jacket Status: Jacketed)<br><br>These stories (and stories within stories, and stories within stories within stories), told by the Princess Shahrazad under the threat of death if she ceases to amuse, first reached the West around 1700.

Butler's (Bashi, Elephant Baby) acrylic and colored pencil illustrations realistically capture nine achingly adorable animals. He infuses his renderings of the cotton puff-like owlet that opens the book, a sweetly gawky zebra calf and a polar bear cub with just the right amount of romanticism. Glints of lavender play in the animals' fur, the trace of a smile can be detected on a bill or mouth and the artist misses no opportunity to emphasize those huge, heart-tugging eyes. The book concludes with a spread that invites youngsters to match the babies with their mothers and a page that labels each offspring with its official name (a koala baby is called a joey, a seal baby is a pup, etc.).

It is chiefly concerned with the designing of gardens in relation to their site, to the choice and associations of plant material, as well as its suitability for the plan of the garden, and the natural factors of soil and climate. Russell Page&#39;s main concern has always been the development of garden forms, colours and textures to make a work of art. Russell Page, the most eminent European garden designer, works in a 4000-year-old tradition which stemmed from High Asia and reached a peak in the Islamic Middle East and Southern Mediterranean before finding its last great expression in Renaissance Europe.</p><p>A stunning reissue of a classic by one of the world&#39;s most respected landscape gardeners. &#34;He has written an astonishingly beautiful book about his craft.&#34;--Doris LessingThis is a classic memoir by one of the most famous landscape gardeners of the 20th century which describes the author's training and the development of his many celebrated gardens. Russell Page was born in 1906 and studied art at the Slade School in London before a love of plants drew him to garden design. In his career he designed gardens all over the world, from Leeds Castle in Kent to the Donald M. Kendall Sculpture Garden at the Pepsi Cola Headquarters in New York, as well as in France, his home for many years. <b>The Education of a Gardener</b> is a fascinating portrait of a master of his craft and has proved an inspirational book for many gardeners since its first publication in 1962. Written in clear and elegant prose, it is illustrated with a substantial number of photographs, including, in this edition, hitherto unpublished pictures from Page's files.</p><h2>Offshore</h2><p>&#39;Offshore&#39; is set in the 1960s and describes the relationships amongst a group of houseboat dwellers living on the Thames at Battersea Reach. The novel is part of a reissue programme for all of Fitzgerald&#39;s titles in Flamingo.</p><p><i>Offshore</i> possesses perfect, very odd pitch. In just over 130 pages of the wittiest and most melancholy prose, Penelope Fitzgerald limns the lives of "creatures neither of firm land nor water"--a group of barge-dwellers in London's Battersea Reach, circa 1961. One man, a marine artist whose commissions have dropped off since the war, is attempting to sell his decrepit craft before it sinks. Another, a dutiful businessman with a bored, mutinous wife, knows he should be landlocked but remains drawn to the muddy Thames. A third, Maurice, a male prostitute, doesn't even protest when a criminal acquaintance begins to use his barge as a depot for stolen goods: "The dangerous and the ridiculous were necessary to his life, otherwise tenderness would overwhelm him." <p> At the center of the novel--winner of the 1979 Booker Prize--are Nenna and her truant six- and 11-year-old daughters. The younger sibling "cared nothing for the future, and had, as a result, a great capacity for happiness." But the older girl is considerably less blithe. "Small and thin, with dark eyes which already showed an acceptance of the world's shortcomings," Fitzgerald writes, she "was not like her mother and even less like her father. The crucial moment when children realise that their parents are younger than they are had long since been passed by Martha." </p><p> Their father is farther afield. Unable to bear the prospect of living on the <i>Grace</i>, he's staying in Stoke Newington, part of London but a lost world to his wife and daughters. Meanwhile, Nenna spends her time going over incidents that seem to have led to her current situation, and the matter of some missing squash racquets becomes of increasing import. Though she is peaceful by nature, experience and poverty are wearing Nenna down. Her confidante Maurice, after a momentary spell of optimism, also returns to his life of little expectation and quiet acceptance: "Tenderly responsive to the self-deceptions of others, he was unfortunately too well able to understand his own." </p><p> Penelope Fitzgerald views her creations with deep but wry compassion. Having lived on a barge herself, she offers her expert spin on the dangers, graces, and whimsies of river life. Nenna, too, has become a savant, instantly recognizing on one occasion that the mud encasing the family cat is not from the Reach. This "sagacious brute" is almost as complex as his human counterparts, constantly forced to adjust her notions of vermin and authority. Though Stripey is capable of catching and killing very young rats, the older ones chase <i>her</i>. "The resulting uncertainty as to whether she was coming or going had made her, to some extent, mentally unstable." </p><p> As always, Fitzgerald is a master of the initially bizarre juxtaposition. Adjacent sentences often seem like delightful non sequiturs--until they flash together in an effortless evocation of character, era, and human absurdity. Nenna recalls, for instance, how the buds had dropped off the plant her husband rushed to the hospital when Martha was born. She "had never criticized the bloomless azalea. It was the other young mothers in the beds each side of her who had laughed at it. That had been 1951. Two of the new babies in the ward had been christened Festival." Tiny comical epiphanies such as these have caused the author to be dubbed a "British miniaturist." Yet the phrase utterly misses the risks Fitzgerald's novellas take, the discoveries they make, and the endless pleasures they provide. <i>--Kerry Fried</i></p>Mariner paperback, 1998, previous ISBN&nbsp;978-0-395-47804-2</p><h2>The Guggenheim Collection</h2><p>Originally, Solomon R. Guggenheim donated works from his collection to the Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation, which he began in 1937 to support and promote non-objective art. Then, in 1939, he established the Museum of Non-Objective Painting, which was renamed the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum in 1952, and its signature Frank Lloyd Wright building opened on New York&#39;s Fifth Avenue in 1959. Over time, the Guggenheim has expanded the type of art that it exhibits and collects through the addition of other great collections--notably, those of Karl Nierendorf, Peggy Guggenheim, Justin and Hilde Thannhauser, and Giuseppe Panza di Biumo--as well as through opportunities that resulted from the institution&#39;s increasingly international focus in more recent decades. The Guggenheim today encompasses venues on two continents: the museum in New York, the Peggy Guggenheim Collection in Venice, the Guggenheim Museum Bilbao, the Deutsche Guggenheim in Berlin and the Guggenheim Hermitage Museum in Las Vegas. This volume is published on the occasion of a major exhibition at the Kunst-und Ausstellungshalle der Bundesrepublik Deutschland, Bonn, and the Kunstmuseum Bonn. With its comprehensive presentation of masterworks from the Guggenheim&#39;s extended holdings, it provides insight into Modern and Contemporary art movements--from Impressionism to Cubism, Surrealism to Abstract Expressionism, Pop art and Minimalism to the most recent developments--and the distinctive features of the collection. The selection emphasizes the Guggenheim&#39;s ongoing commitment to acquiring the work of particular artists in depth, including Vasily Kandinsky, Paul Klee, Pablo Picasso, Robert Rauschenberg, Richard Serra and Matthew Barney, among many others.</p><p></p><h2>Day of the Locust</h2><p>Tod Hackett is a brilliant young artist - and a man in danger of losing his heart.

More than analytical thinking, the practice of making crosses offers a way of prayer where understanding comes from doing. <br><br>This new prayer form can take as little or as much time as you have or want to commit. You bring your own creativity to bear and make a representation of the cross of Christ. Each cross is unique, but they all share some deep truths, and Ellen Prewitt invites all to explore the ways in which making crosses can deepen a life lived for Christ. As she explains:<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve found that anyone can make a cross, and by making crosses we are better able to understand what God needs for us to understand about ourselves, our church, or whatever may be working in our lives. To make a cross is to pray in a new way, but it&#x2019;s not as simple as old-fashioned petitionary prayer; making crosses is a way for God to pray through you.&#x201d;<br><br></p><p>Ellen Morris Prewitt is an award-winning writer who turned to making crosses after the tragedy of 9/11. Her writings have appeared in<i> Image, River Teeth, The Rambler</i>, and elsewhere. She was the Peter Taylor Fellow in nonfiction at Kenyon College&#x2019;s Summer Writing Program and her commentaries aired on the local NPR affiliate for many years. She lives in Memphis, Tennessee where, in addition to making crosses, she facilitates a writing group of men and women who live on the streets.</p><h2>Tarts With Tops On or How to Make the Perfect Pie</h2><p>"Is there anyone who doesn't inwardly melt at the sight of a golden glazed pie crust with its little cottage chimney of steam wafting the scent of buried juices, the auguries of delight of what lies beneath A classic steak and kidney, a soothing chicken pie, the crisp crumbliness of a raised hot water pie crust, the sugar-topped exuberance of a fruit pie, its crackling of sweetness concealing the acid fruit below, the buttery spiced whiff of an apple pie..."<p>Tarts with Tops On is a celebration of the pie, this most traditional, comforting, and delicious of foods, as enjoyable in the making as in the eating.</p><p>Tamasin Day-Lewis draws upon classic combinations to create her own versions of many savory pies, such as Bacon and Egg Pie; the Cornish Pasty; Tourte de Pacques, a traditional Easter pie with eggs, artichokes, and spinach; Hunter's Pie; and a delicious Feta, Rice and Yogurt Pie.</p><p>There is a selection of Other People's Pies, Sweet Pies, and a chapter on American Pies that includes Shaker Lemon; Key Lime; Mississippi Mud and Jefferson Davis Pies.</p><p>Tamasin shows how to make pastry for every type of pie, easy infallible recipes that produce pastry invariably superior to anything you can buy.</p><p>Savory or sweet, simple or sophisticated, traditional or innovative, Tarts with Tops On has a pie to impress for every occasion.</p></p><p>Tamasin Day-Lewis is widely regarded as one of the top food writers today.

PETITS PROPOS CULINAIRES (Dec 2004)</p><h2>The Concept of Nature in Marx</h2><p>Schmidt&#x2019;s close reading of Marx&#x2019;s own writings and his relation of them to the positions of Kant, Hegel, Engels, Lenin, the early Lukacs and Sartre, enables him to establish the significance of the mature Marx&#x2019;s sense of the interpenetration of nature and society. He shows how Marxism cuts right across the traditional tendency to counterpose an abstract concept of man with an abstract concept of nature. Schmidt stresses the importance in Marxism of the development of industry and science as the mediation between historical man and external nature, leading either to their reconciliation (if positive) or to their mutual annihilation (if negative). He then both explores this mediation in history and shows how an awareness of its positive and negative possibilities is reflected in such writers as Bertolt Brecht, Walter Benjamin and Ernst Bloch.</p><p><b>Alfred Schmidt</b> was a German social scientist and the author of <i>History and Structure: An Essay on Hegelian-Marxist and Structuralist Theories of History</i>.Text: English, German (translation)</p><h2>Ellen G.

Scott Fitzgerald and Edmund Wilson. A sports writer who became a sensation with his comic baseball bestseller, <i>You Know Me Al</i>, Lardner had a rare gift for inspired nonsense and an ear attuned to the rhythms and hilarious oddities of American speech. He was also a sharp and dispassionate observer of the American scene.

Convalescing from knee surgery in the Damien Day Health Home (known as DODO to the locals) near Hundarby, the temporarily crippled Forsythe is drawn into an oddly assorted group of well-known and powerful fellow patients. Much-married Kate Kapiche, the often malicious owner of the fabulously successful Hair Apparent salons; TV star Carolyn Chimes, whose late ex-husband killed himself over Kate; and painter Harry Oglethorpe had lived in cottages on the Oglethorpe estate 17 years ealier, when the Owen family, nearby farmers, was poisoned to death. When the only survivor, Gareth Owen, turns up as an orderly on the DODO staff, speculation about the unsolved mystery runs rampant. The subsequent murders of Oglethorpe and a nurse cast suspicion on the group of friends as well as Gareth, but it takes the isolation wrought by a major snowstorm to bring about the final, horrifying confrontation. Giroux's well-crafted page-turner has strong elements of suspense and careful characterization embedded in a classical setting. <br>Copyright 1992 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Faeries</h2><p>Very clean, in a very good condition, no notes or highlighting inside, it is in a very good shape, ship fast.</p><p>Brian Froud is an award-winning illustrator, author, and fairy authority.

What goes on behind the scenes in these industries is more suspicious, more devious, more disreputable than you could have ever imagined. Rosenberg&#39;s message is clear: the pharmaceutical and agricultural industries are tainting public health through marketing disguised as medical education and research, aggressive lobbying, and high-level conflicts of interest. If you&#39;re concerned about the safety of the drugs you take and the food you eat, you owe it to yourself to read this important book.Having gained the trust of more than twenty doctors, researchers, and experts who were willing to come forward and finally tell all, reporter and editorial cartoonist Rosenberg presents us with her shocking findings. Explosive material from whistle-blowers, scientists, unsealed lawsuits, and Big Pharma&#39;s and Big Food&#39;s own marketers exposes how these industries put profits before public safety and how the government puts the interests of business before the welfare of consumers, creating a double whammy that &#34;pimps&#34; the public health. What Rosenberg reveals about government complicity, regulatory food- and drug-safety lapses, and legislative injustices will both shock and appall.</p><p><b>Martha Rosenberg</b> is a freelance writer and editorial cartoonist.

Finding his interests lay with people, not things, he went back to college and completed a B.A. in Social Psychology (1978) and a M.S. in Management/Organizational Psychology (1981). He has also completed all the required course work for doctorates in Education at Georgia State University (1985) and Spiritual Psychology at the California Institute for Integral Studies (1993). In 1998, Robert earned his Doctorate in Spiritual Psychology at the College of Metaphysical Science. He has worked as an Organizational Psychologist specializing in improving communication and resolving conflicts within companies. The experiential methods he used for handling confrontation are presented in his latest book, Handling Verbal Confrontation: Take the Fear Out of Facing Others. Robert&#39;s work experience in management and consulting spans over 42 years and crosses major industries: engineering, manufacturing, banking, education, and publishing. Inspired by his inner guidance, Robert started Oughten House Publications in 1992. As a visionary, his publishing company became a world leader in metaphysical and self-mastery books. In July 1997, a major shift in Robert&#39;s life occurred: when his DNA was ACTIVATED and the wisdom to bring it into the world. His ability to encode and activate the multi-strand DNA within chromosomes, to heal others, and set into motion cellular and psychological healings was revealed. Presenting these techniques globally became his mission. Robert sustains a private counseling practice with his wife, Zeljka Roksandic, a clairvoyant healer, in his mountain home in Binghamton, New York. He continues to offer lectures, seminars, and workshops on the DNA Self-Healing Techniques, ZeRo Point Healing Coaching, and Confronting Skills Training. In addition to his three healing books, Robert has also written two novels: Lady from Atlantis and The Corporate Mule.Scientists and medical researchers have conquered what was deemed impossible fifty years ago. Yet as more is discovered, the opportunity of the unknown reveals itself even more. Our explorations have brought us to the outer limits of the universe, proving that there are at least 250 billion suns within our galaxy and trillions of galaxies within the observed universe. Fantastic? Yes! <p> Looking within our bodies is equally profound. According to ancient Hermetic Principles, the dynamics of cells are parallel to the dynamics of galaxies. The vast space that exists between the electrons and nucleus of each atom within various molecules is consistently being explored by quantum physics. However, the most powerful electron microscope cannot reveal the basis of life-the magnificent organization of DNA within our own cells. How does DNA sequence itself to contain the specific blueprints for our bodies? What causes aging and disease? Will we ever find out? The answer is YES! </p><p> A worldwide initiative, the Human Genome Project, is exploring the genetic code, and has already cost more than was spent putting a man on the Moon. The Associated Press reported (November 24, 1999) that "scientists have sequenced one-third of the human genetic pattern and are on schedule to complete the entire biological blueprint by 2003," according to Dr. Francis Collins, Head of the National Human Genome Project. Dr. Collins stated that "one billion of the three billion chemical base pairs in the genetic pattern have now be identified, sequenced and published on a public database." </p><p> Research is still incomplete as thousands of researchers worldwide seek to better understand our DNA. Mapping out the chromosomes, which are made up of DNA, involves over 100,000 genes. Once identified, the "key" to life may be known. But let's go one step further and ask: "Who put the key there?" and "What intelligence is guiding the DNA to perform the most intricate and perfected tasks mankind has ever witnessed?" </p><p> The core issue is even more subtle-learning how the cells and their DNA communicate! Once that is identified, the mysteries of life can unfold as we listen to what is being said. Or, maybe, the DNA will listen to us. After you've applied the techniques in this book, your DNA will be changed and so will your life. </p><p> The unique attributes of DNA and RNA center around their ability to replicate and communicate. Cell division is a marvelous process which deserves the label "miracle." Did you know that when a cell divides and replicates itself, the entire DNA also replicates itself? </p><p> The highest form of intelligence is the ability to communicate. Communication requires us to be aware of our intent. And, when we raise our intent to the highest levels of knowingness, we begin the process of creation. Intent is the highest form of creation. Heart-driven intent is faith in motion. The key to life resides within our capacity to use our intent and influence change within ourselves. </p><p> DNA appears to be complex, but it consists mainly of simple sugar and four nitrogenous base molecules. How do they know what to do? Your life depends on the way these molecules think, act, influence and replicate, but do we have a say in what they do? Again, the answer is yes. You do have a say. </p><p> The world and our lives are rapidly changing. Time seems to disappear right before our eyes. Predictions of the "end times" are all about us and we ask: "What is really happening?" and "Why?" </p><p> It is time for mankind to take a quantum leap for itself. Our mental and physical health has become too dependent on others. We are faced with being led and even misguided by what "they" say. It's always "them." You have a vital part in what you do with your health, when speaking your mind, and creating those things in life which bring you joy. The time is now! Take responsibility for your life-go within. Learn that self-mastery is your gift. You possess all the conscious intent and subtle energies to change your realties, including your DNA. Activate yourself, acknowledge your divine self. Become all you can be! Now is the time to change your DNA and change your life.</p></p><h2>Nutrition Made Clear</h2><p>&#34;Nutrition Made Clear&#34; is your opportunity to finally sort through nutrition misconceptions and replace them with hard science you can understand.

Danijel Zezelj has worked on Weird War Tales and Flinch, and his illustrations regularly appear in The New York Times Book Review and The Washington Chronicle.In the title story of this second volume by <i>100 Bullets </i>writer Azzarello of his jet-black, ultraviolent western set in a corrupt Reconstruction-era town, the universally despised, mean-as-a-polecat new sheriff (and former Confederate soldier) Wes Cutter sets about investigating a series of gruesome murders. But the motives and victims are intimately tied to the town's muddy history, and Cutter finds himself targeted as the next job for the undertaker. The main story is preceded by three shorter character sketches, fleshing out Cutter's personal history as well as the backstories of his wife, Ruth, and a former slave turned bounty hunter, Atticus Mann. The stories are built around a series of flashbacks in which colorist Patricia Mulvihill's palette shifts from dusty, twilit tones to sunbaked sepia. The artwork&#x2014;two chapters drawn by series cocreator Marcelo Frusin, the rest by Daniel Zezelj and Werther Dell'edera&#x2014;is as stylized and chiaroscuro-laden as a vintage noir movie. What trips up Azzarello's story, though, is its combination of nastiness and understatement&#x2014;there's a lot more cussing and bleeding than there is exposition. The book's deep shadows, oblique images and thick dialect impede clarity, and it takes several readings to even make sense of the brutal, surprising conclusion. <i>(Mar.) </i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

As always with Rendell, these stories of mystery and wrongdoing shine their light into the dark places of the human psyche.</p><p>Ruth Rendell is crime fiction at its very best. Her first novel, From Doon With Death, appeared in 1964, and since then her reputation and readership have grown steadily with each new book. She has received major awards for her work; three Edgars from the Mystery Writers of America; the Crime Writers&#39; Gold Dagger Award for 1976&#39;s best crime novel, A Demon in My View; the Arts Council National Book Award for Genre Fiction in 1981 for The Lake of Darkness; the Crime Writer&#39;s Gold Dagger Award for 1986&#39;s best crime novel for Live Flesh; in 1987 the Crime Writer&#39;s Gold Dagger Award for A Fatal Inversion and in 1991 the same award for King Solomon&#39;s Carpet, both written under the pseudonym Barbara Vine; the Sunday Times Literary Award in 1990; and in 1991 the Crime Writer&#39;s Cartier Diamond Award for outstanding contribution to the genre. Her books are translated into 21 languages.Inside or outside the mystery genre, Rendell is one of the finest writers of our time. Her piercing insights into the darkest reaches of the human psyche, her revealing descriptions of human emotions, and her delicate but unrestrained probing into the depths of the human soul elevate her to the very top of her field. In this collection of short stories, Rendell is at her best, using her own quixotic brand of dark humor and an often heartwrenching poignancy to produce 11 minimasterpieces. Whether she's exploring a young woman's deep-rooted need for love and friendship ("The Strawberry Tree" ), the anger brought on when an insecure ego is wounded and exposed ("The Man Who Was the God of Love" ), or the dark shame of unreasonable obsession ("Clothes" ), Rendell is able to expose the humanity (or in some cases, the inhumanity) beneath the everyday facade, allowing her readers to feel not only an empathetic sense of recognition but also a small shock of horror at the thin line that separates "us" from "them." Rendell's prose is simple and straightforward, as devoid of artifice as a woman without makeup. But the effect of her writing is as disturbing and provocative as seeing the modest, rather dull woman next door suddenly appear in tart's clothing, heavily rouged and with blood-red lips. A must-have collection by one of the world's most talented authors. <i>Emily Melton</i></p><h2>Success</h2><p>In <b>Success</b> Amis pens a mismatched pair of foster brothers--one "a quivering condom of neurosis and ineptitude," the other a "bundle of contempt, vanity and stock-response"--in a single London flat. He binds them with ties of class hatred, sexual rivalry, and disappointed love, and throws in a disloyal girlfriend and a spectacularly unstable sister to create a modern-day Jacobean revenge comedy that soars with malicious poetry.<br><i>From the Trade Paperback edition.</i></p><p>Martin Amis is the best-selling author of several books, including <b>London Fields</b>, <b>Money</b>, <b>The Information</b>, and, most recently, <b>Experience</b>. He lives in London.Amis's American reputation is accelerating, and this early novel, published in Britain nine years ago, is appearing here for the first time. It bears his usual hallmarks: an irresistible narrative flow, writing that seems effortlessly to embrace extremes of tough verismo and delicate poetry, and a remorseless cynicism that one London reviewer has unerringly characterized as "exhilarating unpleasantness." Amis's tale is of two foster brothers: Gregory, an aristocratic, self-deluded esthete and sexual all-rounder, and his lower-class adopted sibling Terry, who is as physically uncouth as Gregory is gorgeous, but whose grim tenacity and realism enable him to prevail in the hideous social struggle that is Amis's vision of London in the '70s. This is not a book for the squeamish: there is misogynism and racism galore (shades of Amis pere?), an obsessive attention to the messier bodily functions, a prevailing mood of apocalyptic hysteria and a number of comic asides that inspire winces more often than laughs. Amis is a vast talent who seems to have only his prose under control; but there is no escaping his ghastly readability, or the way his festering visions linger in the mind. <br>Copyright 1987 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Veshje Popullore Shqiptare Albanian Fold Costumes (2)</h2><p>This book is the second volume of &#34;Albanian Folk Costumes&#34; corpus belonging to editions &#34; The Heritage of Albanian People&#34; of Fold Culture Institute, Department of Ethnology, Tirana.</p><p></p><h2>Philosophy in the Garden</h2><p><p><strong>Why did Marcel Proust have bonsai beside his bed?

Gaining recognition as a post-Misty poet in the late &#x2019;80s, Xi Chuan was famous for his condensed, numinous lyricism, and for radiating classical Chinese influences as much as Western modernist traditions. After the crushing failure of Tiananmen Square and the death of two of his closest friends, he stopped writing for three years. He re-emerged transformed: he began writing meditative, expansive prose poems that dismantled the aestheticism and musicality of his previous self. Divided into two sections that hinge around this formal break, <em>Notes on the Mosquito</em> offers the greatest hits of a deeply engaging poet, whose work intertwines the mountains and roads of Xinjiang with insects and mythical beasts, ghosts and sacred spirits with chess and a Sanskrit inscription.</p><p><p><b>Xi Chuan</b>, born in 1963 in Xuzhou, Jiangsu province, is a poet, essayist, and translator.

At the time, he was translating Ezra Pound and Tomas Transtr�mer, Czeslaw Milosz and Jorge Luis Borges, and his own writing suggests a corresponding sophistication and aesthetic range.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Robert Hass, <em>The Believer</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;What unites his lyric poems and his essay-poems is that they all carry a sense of the world&#x2019;s plenitude -- evoked so gorgeously in a poem like &#x201c;South Xinjiang Notes&#x201d; -- and of the world&#x2019;s puzzlement. The plenitude is itself bewildering (what to make of the Turkic Muslims he runs into in beautiful South Xinjiang?) and the bewilderment has a certain beauty.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>Bookslut</em></strong></p><h2>A Tale of the I Ching: How the Book of Changes Began (I Ching Wisdom)</h2><p>From the author of the acclaimed <i>I Ching: The Book of Answers,</i> this magical tale takes us on an enchanted journey back in time to the origins of the I Ching in ancient China. <br><br><i>A Tale of the I Ching</i> tells the story of the young village ne'er-do-well, who becomes the first disciple of the great sage emperor Fu Hsi&#x2015;the creator of the I Ching.

Reprint.</p><p>Using quotations from actual letters, characters under their actual names, and events straight out of history, Mexican novelist Elena Poniatowska has reimagined the life of actress and Communist agent Tina Modotti. Modotti was the lover of photographer Edward Weston, the friend of Diego Rivera and other artists, and an agent for the Soviet Union during the murky events of the Spanish Civil War. Poniatowska brushes aside questions of morality and politics to present Tina Modotti as an impetuous romantic, a heroine regardless of the rightness of her cause. The Spanish Civil War forms the backdrop for the last and most dramatic stage of Modotti&#39;s life: she was the lover of Vittorio Vidali, who specialized in assassinating anti-Stalinist leftists. Regardless of the stature of the book as literature, it gives a portrait of one of the most fascinating characters on the world stage between the World Wars.This fictionalized account of the life of Tina Modotti is a fascinating story of the complex woman caught up in the social and political turbulence of the pre-World War II era.</p><h2>American impressionism</h2><p>Lavishly illustrated with more than 400 paintings by 125 different atrists, this luscious book will thoroughly satisfy the ever-growing passion for American Impressionism.

She wrote these short pieces later in life and they rekindled in her strong childhood memories and associations. She delights in the brightness of buttercups that &#34;let Spring&#39;s secret out&#34;, muses over the hardiness of stonecrop (&#34;How any plant can grow on bare rock and be so fleshy leafed and fat is a marvel.&#34;) and declares that &#34;botanical science has un-skunked the skunk cabbage&#34;. Carr&#39;s playful words often bring a smile to readers. About catnip, she writes: &#34;I did think it was kind of God to make a special flower for cats.&#34; In a brief Foreword and Afterword, archivist and historian Kathryn Bridge gives context to Wild Flowers within the body of Carr&#39;s previously published writings. Wild Flowers is illustrated with beautiful watercolours of wild plants by Emily Henrietta Woods, one of Carr&#39;s childhood drawing teachers in Victoria. The originals of Carr&#39;s manuscript and Woods&#39; botanical illustrations reside in collections of the BC Archives; neither have been published until now. &#34;Woods&#39; paintings fit so well with Carr&#39;s text. It&#39;s serendipity that Woods taught Carr and that we have her art and Carr&#39;s manuscript in the Archives&#39; collection, and that neither have been published before now.&#34; - Kathryn Bridge</p><p>In this delightful collection, beloved artist and writer Emily Carr (1871-1945) celebrates wild flowers and shrubs.Beloved Canadian artist and writer Emily Carr (December 13, 1871--March 2, 1945) was born in Victoria, British Columbia. She studied art in the U.S., England and France until 1911, when she moved back to British Columbia. Carr was most heavily influenced by the landscapes and First Nations cultures of British Columbia and Alaska. In the 1920s she came into contact with members of the Group of Seven and was later invited to submit her works for inclusion in a Group of Seven exhibition. They named her The Mother of Modern Arts about five years later. Emily Henrietta Woods (1852-1916) came to Victoria from Ireland in 1865. Her talent for art gained her employment as a drawing teacher, and Emily Carr was one of her students. But her life&#39;s work was the creation of over 200 life-size watercolours of wild flowers, some of which appear in this book.</p><h2>Technical Textiles</h2><p>The textile industry is one of the oldest in India and is intrinsically linked to a range of traditions and cultures that is a reflection of the diversity that prevails in our country. One of the segments of this industry that has received significant attention across the world is technical textiles. Technical or engineered textiles are defined as products that are used for functional purposes. Based on usage, there are 12 technical textile segments; Agrotech, Meditech, Buildtech, Mobiltech, Clothtech, Oekotech, Geotech, Packtech, Hometech, Protech, Indutech and Sportech. India continues to be the preferred destination for textile manufacturing and provides a whole lot of advantages in the area of technical textiles. Some technical textiles require encouragement for use by user academics/ industries and some require prescription. Technical Textile presents a basics and readable introduction into the field of technical Textile. It is based on an elementary level course focusing on the Agrotech, Meditech, Mobiltech, Geotech, Protech, and finishing of technical textiles. The book also provides the technicians and engineers in the textile industry fundamental of processes and application for technical textile. The book covers processing information for the technical textiles, describing materials, processes, finishing and applications. To provide a better understanding of the individual technical textile category, each chapter deals with an example describing the respective application for a technical product.

Mann switches focus from pop novelist Jeff O'Brien and hotelier Lloyd Griffith (longtime companions) to another Provincetown hottie, Jeff's best friend, Henry Weiner, whose complex trek from geek to hustler was a feature of the last book. Henry's a "washashore," as the locals call those who come to Provincetown to live year-round&#x2014;adrift, restless, always on the prowl&#x2014;and is managing Nirvana, the popular guesthouse co-owned by Jeff and Lloyd. Over the course of a Provincetown summer, Henry searches for Mr. Right, meeting and bedding a parade of sexy men: Luke is a sly, possibly psychotic would-be novelist who picks up Henry to get to Jeff; Martin is impossibly old at 45; Gale refuses to drop his pants on the first date; Shane, Henry's ex-, returns with a ring on his finger. Mann gets off some funny lines and smiles wryly on the longings of his characters. There's also a nice side plot in Jeff's nine-year-old nephew-ward JR, who struggles with his latent heterosexuality. Henry's odyssey, however, isn't sustaining, and the resolution falls flat. <i>(Apr.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Always enquiring and investigating, he explored the formal vocabulary of European avant-garde art movements and synthesised them to produce a distinctive graphic language.</p><p>IBM, UPS, ABC. If these acronyms ring a bell, their ubiquitous logos springing instantly to mind, then you know the work of Paul Rand (1914-1996), the Picasso of Graphic Design. A pioneer in the field of visual communication, Rand developed a fresh and individual design language drawn from European art movements including Russian constructivism, de Stijl, and the Bauhaus. His career as an art director, teacher, writer, and design consultant to major corporations spanned almost seven decades. Rand arguably got his start at the tender of 3 when he first began to secretly copy pictures of the attractive Palmolive models pictured in advertising displays in his father's grocery store in Brooklyn, New York. He later modeled his aesthetic on avant-garde artists like Paul Klee, El Lissitzky, and architect Le Corbusier, each of whom advocated a timeless spirit in design. Rand began his career in an era when working by hand was a given, a reality that would change before his eyes as the mass media, entertainment, and consumer industries were revolutionized by increasingly technical equipment, and ultimately the computer.<p> Steven Heller, senior art director at <i>The New York Times</i> and prominent author of numerous design books, presents this meticulously researched and detailed survey, which marks the first complete retrospective of Rand's powerful body of work, exploring the full range of his advertising, publishing, and corporate identity projects. Eminent designer Armin Hofmann writes the forward, and the introduction is penned by advertising legend George Lois, who writes, "The constant concern of the scholarly and humanistic Paul Rand was to create images that snared people's eyes, penetrated their minds, warmed their hearts and made them act." Appropriately, the designers of this large, bold, beautifully designed book seem well versed in Randism themselves, creating a gorgeous tribute to this quintessential artist's artist. Rand's uncanny ability to inject wit and whimsy into the corporate vocabulary is echoed here, for example, in an enlarged reproduction of an opened children's book whose spine is aligned with that of the actual book held by the reader, creating a playful trompe l'oeil effect. At 255 pages, with a staggering 452 illustrations (over 300 in color), this book is a delightful and inspiring must-have. <i>--A.C. Smith</i></p>Steven Heller is Senior Art Director at The New York Times. He is also editor of the AIGA Journal of Graphic Design and co-chair MFA/Design Program of the School of Visual Arts in New York. He is author and co-author of numerous books including Graphic Style: From Victorian to Post-Modern and Graphic Wit and Design Literacy: Understanding Graphic Design. In 1996, Heller received the New York Art Directors&#39; Special Educator&#39;s Award. Armin Hofmann is one of Switzerland&#39;s foremost graphic designers who taught with Rand at Yale and at the Brissago Summer School. George Lois, wunderkind of American advertising, says he owes everything to Rand. In his own right, Lois is the first among equals in the creative revolution in US advertising - he was responsible for the original VW campaign - and no more eminent figure exists in the field. He is author of The Art of Advertising and his most recent book What&#39;s the Big Idea? (1991) was widely acclaimed. Jessica Helfand, a former Rand student at Yale, is the new-media columnist for Eye magazine and writes regularly for i-D, Print and the AIGA Journal on design issues.

The authors analyse reactions to the attacks through the lens of terror management theory, an existenial psychological model that explains why humans react the way they do to the threat of death and how this reaction influences their post-threat cognition and emotion. The theory provides ways to understand and reduce terrorism&#39;s effect and possibly find resolutions to conflicts involving terrorism.

In doing so, their work lays the groundwork for an experimental existential psychology, a new perspective on the human condition influencing current thinking on a wide range of issues within psychology. Their work has yielded a wealth of new insights into diverse aspects of the human condition, including self-esteem striving, prejudice, intergroup conflict, human sexuality, unconscious motives, conformity, aggression, creativity, altruism, and love. </p><p>Currently, the three authors are professors of psychology&#x2014;Dr. Pyszczynski at the University of Colorado at Colorado Springs, Dr. Solomon at Skidmore College, and Dr. Greenberg at the University of Arizona.</p>"...beautifully scientific, richly interdisciplinary, and profoundly relevant." -- <i>Lyn Y.

In this regard, it is interesting that Sub� stance P, which has been proposed as a putative neurotransmitter in the spinal cord, was rediscovered by Leeman and her co-workers during their search for the corticotropin-releasing factor in the hypothalamus. Indeed, with the wide� spread availability and use of radioimmunoassay techniques, it has become ap� parent that various &#34;hypothalamic releasing factors&#34; are localized in extrahypo� thalamic areas of the central nervous system as well. This book represents an expression of the belief that the impact on neurobiology of research into neuro� peptides will be comparable to, if not greater than, the recent achievements obtained with the biogenic amines. As already appears to be the case, future inves� tigations on brain pep tides will undoubtedly uncover a host of new transmitter candidates, with obvious implications for neuropharmacology. Perhaps the most dramatic developments in this field have been the discoveries of the endogenous opiate peptides (enkephalin and endorphin), and the profound physiological and behavioral effects of specific peptides.</p><p></p><h2>The Camera Does the Rest: How Polaroid Changed Photography</h2><p>In a world where nearly everyone has a cellphone camera capable of zapping countless instant photos, it can be a challenge to remember just how special and transformative Polaroid photography was in its day. And yet, there&#x2019;s still something magical for those of us who recall waiting for a Polaroid picture to develop. Writing in the context of two Polaroid Corporation bankruptcies, not to mention the obsolescence of its film, Peter Buse argues that Polaroid was, and is, distinguished by its process&#x2014;by the fact that, as the <i>New York Times</i> put it in 1947, &#x201c;the camera does the rest.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> Polaroid was often dismissed as a toy, but Buse takes it seriously, showing how it encouraged photographic play as well as new forms of artistic practice. Drawing on unprecedented access to the archives of the Polaroid Corporation, Buse reveals Polaroid as photography at its most intimate, where the photographer, photograph, and subject sit in close proximity in both time and space&#x2014;making Polaroid not only the perfect party camera but also the tool for frankly salacious pictures taking.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> Along the way, Buse tells the story of the Polaroid Corporation and its ultimately doomed hard-copy wager against the rising tide of digital imaging technology. He explores the continuities and the differences between Polaroid and digital, reflecting on what Polaroid can tell us about how we snap photos today. Richly illustrated, <i>The Camera Does the Rest</i> will delight historians, art critics, analog fanatics, photographers, and all those who miss the thrill of waiting to see what develops.</p><p><b>Peter Buse </b>is professor and head of performance and screen studies at Kingston University, London. He is the author of <i>Drama + Theory</i> and coauthor of <i>The Cinema of Alex de la Iglesia</i> and <i>Benjamin&#x2019;s Arcades: An unGuided Tour</i>, as well as editor of <i>Ghosts: Deconstruction, Psychoanalysis, History</i>. He lives in London."As Buse argues in his smart and engaging <i>The Camera Does the Rest: How Polaroid Changed Photography</i>, amateur picture taking was originally conceived of as 'a form of play'....Looking at a Polaroid is unlike looking at any other picture because a Polaroid has that which a photograph is supposed to lack: an aura. Each shot is singular, unrepeatable; each life, a story; each image, a measure of hungry, sucking time." (<i>Harper's</i>)<br><br>"<i>The Camera Does the Rest</i> is the best kind of cultural study, and refreshingly jargon-free.&nbsp;Buse steers a course between the mockers and admirers, and brings concision, shape and clarity to a complex subject through his skillful plundering of the enormous Polaroid archive in Harvard Business School's Baker Library. This well-illustrated, handsomely produced book is rich in facts, speculation, and anecdotes." (<i>Times Literary Supplement</i>)<br><br>"Scholarly yet joyful.&#x201d; (<i>Wall Street Journal</i>)<br><br>"Mining the Polaroid archives in the Baker Library Historical Collections, Harvard Business School, Buse researches how Polaroid cameras were marketed, the aesthetics of the Polaroid print, and the social rituals associated with owning and taking instant images. Other books detail the life of Polaroid&#x2019;s founder Edwin H. Land and examine the company&#x2019;s distinctive milieu; this scholarly cultural history is distinguished by Buse&#x2019;s background in �performance studies. The author is less interested in studying pictures than he is in thinking about the performative moment of taking and sharing instant photos, an aspect unique to Polaroid&#x2014;until digital photography came into existence&#x2014;an innovation that led to Polaroid&#x2019;s demise but was also facilitated by instant film. For readers interested in photography history, the cultural history of technology, innovation, and business �history." (<i>Library Journal</i>)<br><br>"Critic and theorist Buse&#x2019;s fine examination of the cultural history of Polaroid technology,&nbsp;<i>The Camera Does the Rest</i>, considers the societal forces at work as the company succeeded and failed, from the launch of its first camera in 1948 to its existence today.&nbsp;Scholarly and philosophical, the book is an intriguing read, although not a casual one.&nbsp;Buse&#x2019;s answers offer insights into our interactions with technologies over time, as well as new ways of understanding the evolution of contemporary shutterbugs." (<i>American Scientist</i>)<br><br>"?Polaroid is a technology whose sun has set. It casts long shadows nevertheless, and in this afterglow Buse pursues two lines of inquiry, both fascinating....One may debate the relative powers of the photograph when treated as a memento, or as a tangible object, or as a social act&#x2014;and the history of the company reads like a pr�cis of popular image technology in the 20th century. But,&nbsp;as Buse demonstrates, in being so different from so many other kinds of photographs, the Polaroid helps to reveal what photography has been, and what it does." (<i>The Nation</i>)<br><br>"<i>The Camera Does the Rest</i> takes a deep dive into&nbsp;Polaroid&#x2019;s corporate archives to reveal the company&#x2019;s transformative influence&nbsp;on the photographic process. This book covers all of the cultural perceptions and scientific discoveries that made Polaroid something very special and leaves us with a clear sense of&nbsp;its lost pleasures, too. For Buse, Polaroid is not just an object of nostalgia,&nbsp;it is a catalyst undeniably linked to the massive changes we've seen in social&nbsp;rituals and imaging technology in our lifetime." (<i>American Photo</i>)<br><br>"<i>The Camera Does the Rest</i> is a well-researched and thorough history of Polaroid photography, covering both the technical aspects of the cameras and their film, and the influence of this technology on society. It&#x2019;s generously illustrated but is by no means a coffee-table book. Instead, it&#x2019;s a serious history and analysis of the Polaroid phenomenon, and each illustration is included to make some point.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp; (<i>PopMatters</i>)<br><br>"Buse poses a linked series of questions, and the answers and reflections about the industrial, social, cultural, and artistic responses to Polaroid tell its unique history from its rise to its fall. His intelligent, thoughtful, well-written essays provide the framework for an excellent overview of the subject." (<i>Choice</i>)<br><br><p>"<i>The Camera Does the Rest</i>&nbsp;has a richness of detail and language. Buse turns to myriad unconventional but vivid sources in his effort to resurrect just what it felt like to make, pose for, and view Polaroid images. This experience of instant photography is his true focus, and he addresses it from multiple, new, persuasive perspectives. In so doing, he makes the magic of the Polaroid moment vivid for those readers for whom that era is now a faint memory and for those readers too young to have experienced it. To my knowledge, the book has no peers in evoking the lost moments of Polaroid photography. While this alone makes it a mighty contribution to the study of visual culture, I would suggest that, in addition, the archeological approach Buse takes to his topic serves as an excellent model for<b>&nbsp;</b>scholars seeking in its archaeological approach, how to recuperate the novelty experienced when now familiar technologies were once new."</p> (<i>Technology and Culture</i>)</p><h2>Understandable Statistics: Concepts and Methods (AP Edition)</h2><p>UNDERSTANDABLE STATISTICS: CONCEPTS AND METHODS, Twelfth Edition, is a thorough yet accessible program designed to help students overcome their apprehensions about statistics.

Blogging, says Stoller, allows him to bring an anthropological perspective to contemporary debates, but it also makes him a better writer: snappier, more concise, and more focused on the connection he wants to make with readers. In this collection of selected blog posts, Stoller models good writing while sharing his insights on politics (including the emergence of "Trumpism" and the impact of ignorance on US political practices), higher education, social science, media, and well-being. In the process, he discusses the changing nature of scholarly communication and the academy&#x2019;s need for greater public engagement.</p></p><p><b>Paul Stoller</b> is Professor of Anthropology at West Chester University. He has published 14 books, including ethnographies, biographies, memoirs, and novels, and is a recipient of a Guggenheim Fellowship and the Robert B. Textor and Family Prize for Excellence in Anticipatory Anthropology. In 2013, King Carl XVI Gustaf of Sweden presented him the Anders Retzius Gold Medal in Anthropology. In 2015, the American Anthropological Association awarded him the Anthropology in Media Award.<br><p><strong>PART ONE </strong></p><br><p><strong>BLOGGING POLITICS IN THE AGE OF TRUMP </strong></p><br><p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong> </p><br><p>These days just about everyone engages in some form of blogging. If you post a message on Facebook, or make a comment about something that you have retweeted, you are microblogging. If you post a photo with a caption on Instagram, you are also microblogging. These messages, which can be terse or detailed, can be about a wide variety of subjects. These may be personal (family relations, birthdays, reunions, travel, medical updates), social (comments about race relations, income and/or health inequities, grassroots social movements), professional (notification of conferences, announcements of grant awards and article and book publications), or political (commentary on public policy, the effectiveness of government, or a political campaign). No matter the subject, a personal microblog is an invitation for an online conversation, which is, in turn, an invitation to connect or reconnect with people in a digital network. </p><br><p>The public blogs that constitute <em>Adventures in Blogging</em> differ from personal posts. Like personal posts, public blogs are invitations to a conversation. Indeed, if a public blog is widely shared on Facebook or retweeted on Twitter, it prompts both online and off-line conversations. The public blog, however, is longer and more detailed than a microblog. The goal of the public blog, moreover, is to reach readers beyond the blogger&#x2019;s personal network. In addition, the public blog usually showcases some degree of expertise about a wide assortment of subjects. If the expertise is communicated in a short, plainly articulated text, it may attract a large and diverse audience. For scholars, the public blog is one way to communicate insights, derived through rigorous research and scholarly reflection, to an increasingly wiredin audience. Blogging, then, is an effective way to contribute slowly developed insights in a culture of speed and expedience. </p><br><p>In this part of <em>Adventures in Blogging</em>, I present public political blogs that I wrote for the <em>Huffington Post</em> in quick response to a variety of political events. My take on contemporary politics, however, is based on years of slowly cultivated thinking about politics in social life. In most of the posts, which are succinct texts comprising short paragraphs, I try to make one point in clear and compelling prose. In some of the blogs, I use narrative techniques&#x2014;description and dialogue. The political blog is therefore a relatively slow intervention in the culture of speed. </p><br><p>Politics provides a wonderful domain for anthropological reflection. In the United States, politics has become a profoundly social and cultural arena of public debate. Considering that much of the political commentary on television and radio often amounts to&#x2014;at best&#x2014;fast and shallow reflection, it is incumbent on anthropologists, among other scholars, to join the conversation. Given the long record of anthropological thinking about social relations and cultural concepts, anthropologists are particularly well placed to write about the practice of politics-in-the-world. </p><br><p>Classic and more recent anthropological concepts can be powerfully employed to explain the behaviors of politicians like Israeli Prime Minister Bibi Netanyahu, President Barack Obama, Florida Governor Rick Scott, or more recently President Donald J. Trump. Anthropological concepts can be used to understand how political institutions like the US Congress function in the turbulent climate of extreme partisanship. They can be employed to probe the social and cultural ramifications of laws like the Affordable Care Act and to consider the social consequences of Republican efforts to replace Obamacare with Trumpcare. Anthropological bloggers are well situated to shed light on the social impact of policies that affect our introduction � 3 fragile environment. They can also use their blogs to resist political oppression and the power of "the big lie." </p><br><p>In academic writing, we tend to tell our readers about things. We articulate a complex argument that refines our thinking about culture, social relations, the evolutionary record, or the dynamics of politics. Indeed, I could go on and on about how an anthropological perspective brings depth and breadth to ongoing political debate. </p><br><p>In our digitally interconnected world, though, blogging politics on wide-circulation social media news platforms like <em>HuffPost, Slate</em>, and <em>Salon</em> can be a central element in the practice of contemporary public anthropology. These platforms require timely essays that are short, crisp, and accessible to the general public. When a political event occurs, the anthropologically informed political blogger who follows the news regularly decides which item she or he can write about with a degree of expertise and then responds with dispatch. The news landscape, after all, is ever-shifting. </p><br><p>How do you link news material to anthropological concepts? In the political blogs that follow, I&#x2019;ve tried to produce such linkages. In March 2016, when candidate Donald Trump swept the Super Tuesday Republican primaries to assure his presidential nomination, I posted on <em>HuffPost</em> "The Anthropology of Trump" (see Chapter 7), in which I tried to demonstrate how the American culture of celebrity had, in large measure, propelled his victories. </p><br><p>The relatively speedy practice of blogging in the popular media may seem like an affront to the slow work of anthropology in which scholars spend years engaged in study, reflection, and writing to produce faithful representations of social life. That pursuit is a noble one. Public political blogs, however, are not an affront to established anthropological practice, for bloggers can&#x2014;and do&#x2014;employ slowly developed anthropological concepts. In the political blogs that follow, I use such time-honored concepts as economic exchange, social class, culture, and race to craft my posts. These deliberately developed concepts can be used to compose hard-hitting political blogs that make one powerful point in 850 clearly and simply expressed words. It sounds daunting, but with practice, it can be done with great efficacy&#x2014;a very good way to engage in the public anthropology of contemporary American politics. </p></p><h2>The Golden Ass (Oxford World&#39;s Classics)</h2><p>Apuleius's <em>Golden Ass</em> is a unique, entertaining, and thoroughly readable Latin novel--the only work of fiction in Latin to have survived from antiquity. It tells the story of the hero Lucius, whose curiosity and fascination for sex and magic results in his transformation into an ass. After suffering a series of trials and humiliations, he is ultimately returned to human shape by the kindness of the goddess Isis. Simultaneously a blend of romantic adventure, fable, and religious testament, <em>The Golden Ass</em> is one of the truly seminal works of European literature, of intrinsic interest as a novel in its own right, and one of the earliest examples of the picaresque. This new translation is at once faithful to the meaning of the Latin, while reproducing all the exuberance of the original.</p><p>P. G. Walsh is Professor Emeritus of Humanity at the University of Glasgow.<br>"An execllent introduction and an accurate...translation."--Jim Williams, <em>SUNY at Genesco</em><p></p><br>"This translation deserves the highest praise. It is idiomatic whenever possible, clear and effective throughout; I am more impressed with it than with three others that I have sampled. The introduction is informative and balanced in judgment."--Philip F. O'Mara, <em>Bridgewater College</em><p></p><br>"This is a good edition. The translation flows, the introduction is thorough."--Richard Mason, <em>George Mason University</em><p></p><br>"[A] fresh, funny, evocative translation that captures Apuleius at his most uncanny."--W. Gardern Campbell, <em>Mary washington College</em><p></p><br>"Walsh's new rendering--which on every page, improves upon the commonly used and dated translations of Jack Lindsay and Robert Graves--appears at a time when this ever popular novel is even more greatly appreciated by social historians for the window it provides on provincial life among real imperial subjects in the second century CE. This edition is enhanced by an excellent introduction, a select bibliography, explanatory notes, and an index and glossary of names....It should quickly become the obvious choice for Latin-less readers."--<em>Religious Studies Review6R<p></p></em><br>"This translation is literal enough to come to a scholar's aid, and at the same time scholarly enough to use without embarrassment."--<em>Bryn Mawr Classical Review</em><p></p><br>"P.G. Walsh has given us an excellent translation, contemporary without being too trendy, as well as a superb introduction that gives the historical, philosophical, and religious background of the work....Oxford's <em>World's Classics</em> has done it again, has produced a useful edition and superior translation of a work that has needed it for several generations."--<em>CAES Newsletter</em><p></p><br>"Splendid volume, living up to the scholarly accuracy that makes the World's Classics series."--Professor John R. Lenz, <em>Drew University</em><p></p><br>"OUP's decision to commission a new translation of Apuleius' novel by a scholar who has made a significant contribution to Apuleian studies is a welcome move. This is without doubt the translation I would prescribe for students studying the work in English."--<em>Bryn Mawr Classical Review</em><p></p><br>"The best scholarly introduction and notes among the currently available paperback editions and a very high standard of accuracy in representing the Latin original."--Professor Robert Lamberton, <em>Washington University</em><p></p><br></p><h2>Hypersonic and High-Temperature Gas Dynamics, Second Edition (AIAA Education Series)</h2><p>This book is the second edition of a successful, self-contained text for those students and readers interested in learning hypersonic flow and high-temperature gas dynamics. Like the first edition, it assumes no prior familiarity with either subject on the part of the reader. If you have never studied hypersonic and/or high-temperature gas dynamics before, and if you have never worked extensively in the area, then this book is for you. On the other hand, if you have worked and/or are working in these areas, and you want a cohesive presentation of the fundamentals, a development of important theory and techniques, a discussion of the salient results with emphasis on the physical aspects, and a presentation of modern thinking in these areas, then this book is also for you. In other words, this book is designed for two roles: 1) as an effective classroom text that can be used with ease by the instructor, and understood with ease by the student; and 2) as a viable, professional working tool for engineers, scientists, and managers who have any contact in their jobs with hypersonic and/or high-temperature flow. Because of its success, most of the first edition has been carried over to the second edition with the addition of much new material. <br><br>This second Edition has updated figures and data to compliment the presentation and discussion of the fundamentals. New to this edition are some educational tools that the author has found successful in previous books, namely the inclusion of: (1) previews of each chapter written in plain language to inform the reader why it is important to read and understand the material in the chapter, to highlight the important aspects , and to whip up the reader&#x2019;s passion to consume the chapter; (2) design examples scattered throughout the book to illustrate the application of the fundamentals to the design of hypersonic vehicles and ground test facilities; and (3) roadmaps at the beginning of each chapter to guide the reader comfortably through the material. New subjects discussed in the Second Edition include shock-shock interactions, hypersonic waveriders, and aspects of hypersonic propulsion devices, always in light of the fundamentals emphasized in the main part of the book. <br><br>Finally, this book is for you &#x2013; the reader &#x2013; to take you through an enjoyable tour of the world of Hypersonic and High Temperature Gasdynamics.</p><p>Dr. John Anderson, Jr. received his Ph.D. in Aeronautical and Astronautical Engineering in 1966 from the Ohio State University.

It is the story of innocent people caught in a web of intrigue from which they could not extricate themselves. The author, himself a descendant of one of those executed, argues masterfully that the witch hunt was driven by conspiracies of envious men intent on destroying their enemies. Sanctioned by the old guard of Puritan leaders, these men arrested two hundred people for witchcraft, twenty-eight of whom were executed or died in prison. The convergence of religious, social, political, and economic forces that sparked the accusations and trials are laid out clearly and concisely, exploring the motives and relationships of those who fanned the flames of the witch hunt. Robinson also provides a closer look at the lives of seventy-five of the people accused as witches, analyzing their places in the community and shedding light on why they were targeted.<p>Title of related interest also available from Waveland Press: Edwards (Simonson, ed.), <i>Selected Writings of Jonathan Edwards,</i> Second Edition (ISBN 9781577663317).</p></p><p>The tercentennial of the Salem witchcraft trials--1992--will surely generate a demand for materials on this topic. Robinson supports the current theory involving "highly placed" conspirators in the political and religious leadership of Salem, as well as in Boston. The work, however, focuses not on the theory, but rather on the people. It is alive with individuals bursting with emotions, foibles, and hidden agendas. To read this book is to dwell as one amongst them. There is one caveat: the lengthy descriptions of alliances and extended family ties can get overly involved and confusing. Scholars may prefer Paul Boyer and Stephen Nissenbaum's Salem Possessed: The Social Origins of Witchcraft ( LJ 8/74) or their Salem Witchcraft Papers (Da Capo, 1977). This book will appeal to the general public who may wish to learn and be entertained without the boring trial accounts or gory details. Recommended for public libraries.<br><i>- Suzanne C.

Theirs was a generation willing to die in great numbers for a principle as abstract as union. What motivated them? What have we done with the heritage that they bequeathed to us? This book asks whether America in the 1990s knows what its present character, economics, and society cost, and whether the country&#39;s present battles have as noble a purpose and as hopeful a prospect as the great cataclysm of July 1863 - the Battle of Gettysburg. Walt Whitman perhaps said it best: &#34;&#34;Will the America of the future - will this vast, rich Union ever realize what itself cost back there, after all?&#34;&#34; This is, in effect, the story of two battlefields: Gettysburg during July 1863 and Gettysburg during the 1990s. Following Thoreau&#39;s dictum that &#34;&#34;it is the province of the historian to find out, not what was, but what is, &#34;&#34; the author has searched for contemporary America among the famous places of Gettysburg&#39;s historic landscape: McPherson&#39;s Woods and the Seminary, where the Iron Brigade made its decisive last stand and defined the economics of glory; the town itself, now a monument to the grim struggle of the past and the commercialism of the present; Cemetery Hill, where German gunners defended their pieces with rammers, water buckets, and unintelligible oaths; Seminary Ridge, where a young division commander pondered the meaning of the war and the will of God; Little Round Top, where the 15th Alabama nearly accomplished the humanly impossible; the Peach Orchard, where determination and heroism saved a day that, in the words of Bruce Catton, &#34;&#34;needed a lot of saving&#34;&#34;; the wheat field, where a Yankeecolonel got a deathly glimpse of his future; the field of Pickett&#39;s Charge, where Lee&#39;s chief lieutenant first had to fight out his own lonely battle, and where a doomed and disgraced general then fought and won his battle with history and honor; and finally the battlefield after July</p><p>When the author wrote the following pages I had spent ten years regularly visiting a place in Adams County, Pennsylvania. He tramped its fields, walked its woods, climbed its hills. But death is everywhere- in every meadow, along every Virginia rail fence, all over those quiet, rocky hills at sunset.

The tobacco in the persian slipper, the piles of monographs and newspaper clippings covering the floor and table, the unanswered correspondence affixed to the mantle with a dagger. What will the next visitor or urgent message bring? Perhaps a request from a mysterious stranger to help prevent "A Scandal in Bohemia." Perhaps Watson will tell us the story, discretely leaving out certain names, of how he and Holmes had to step outside the law to protect a certain royal personage from a blackmailer in "The Case of Charles Augustus Milverton." Or, for a very unusual treat, perhaps Holmes himself, in quiet retirement in Sussex, will tell a tale in his own words as in "The Lion's Mane."<br> In the more than a century since the publication of the first tale featuring Sherlock Holmes, <em>A Study in Scarlet</em>, Arthur Conan Doyle's characters and stories have inspired countless films, plays, pastiches, literary tributes, and tens of thousands of imitations.

Toklas</h2><p>Off and on, during the entire period they were together, Gertrude and Alice wrote each other little love notes. Calling her "wifey" and most often addressing her as "baby precious," Stein scribbled her love for Toklas in quick moments of unselfconscious desire, notes that are small but significant testimonies to her long-lived love. And on occasion, Toklas penned or typed letters back to her "husband." <br><br>These notes are brief, mantra-like enticements: tender, beseeching, caring and confessing, funny and game, sexually-charged and sincere, quotidian and queer, but always passionate. Each one marks the pleasures--infrequently, the pains--of married love. When fitted together, the notes create a tantalizing mosaic of a marriage between two women that was built to last.<br></p><p><i>Baby Precious Always Shines</i>, a delightful selection from the 300 love notes that Alice B. Toklas accidentally deposited with the rest of Gertrude Stein's papers in the Beinecke Library at Yale, would not have been possible before the 1980s, when the locked cabinet in which they were kept was finally opened to scholars. In her excellent introduction, Kay Turner (whose other books include <i>I Dream of Madonna: Women's Dreams of the Goddess of Pop</i>) explains that with their baby talk and constant blessings, the notes provide "a tantalizing mosaic of a marriage between two women that was built to last." Composed in the "word-inverted, long-breathed, rolling, repetitive, refluent style that Stein invented," they touch on everyday events in the Stein-Toklas household and reiterate Stein's love and desire for Toklas. Many seem to have been left for Toklas to find in the morning beside the manuscripts that Stein had written during the night. A few were written by Toklas to Stein. Turner also offers a convincing new reading of Stein's famously obscure "cows" (in <i>A Book Concluding with As a Wife Has a Cow: A Love Story</i> and elsewhere), previously thought to signify female orgasm; she argues that Stein and Toklas subscribed to the "cult of regularity" that swept Europe in the first decades of the 20th century. Indeed, the love notes, despite their Steinian verbal play, leave little doubt that the recurring cows, "now sweet smelly and complete," are bowel movements--further evidence, for Turner, of the women's extraordinary intimacy, their love "express[ing] itself daily in the rituals of bodily caretaking.""At last, what I always longed for, an intimate and revealing portrait of Gertrude Stein and Alice Toklas' relationship, painted by the couple themselves, that should put an end to the question: but what can two women do together? Along with Kay Turner's informative and provocative introduction, these letters will fascinate all Stein scholars and aficionados." (Esther Newton, author of <i>Cherry Grove, Fire Island</i> and <i>Mother Camp</i>) <p> "Spontaneous, playful, and decidedly physical, the love notes between Gertrude and Alice offer delight after delight. They afford us a privileged, close look at the mutual desire and devotion of the two most famous lesbians of the 20th century. Kay Turner's insightful introduction illuminates the genius of their reinvention of marriage and makes clear how deeply rooted Stein's body of writing is in the steady daily intimacy of their shared life. A gem of a book." (Joan Larkin, author of <i>Cold River</i> and editor of <i>A Woman Like That</i>) </p><p> "Baby Precious gleams from the stunning title to the final photo of Gertrude, Alice, Basket the poodle, and Pepe the chihuahua. Reflective of one of the 20th century's great love stories, the collection makes a significant contribution to our understanding of the relation between the aesthetic and the erotic, the literary and the quotidian, in the particular context of lesbian self-fashioning." (Elizabeth Meese, author of <i>Sem Erotics</i> and <i>Extensions</i>) </p><p> "Gertrude Stein -that progenitor of modernism and master of the elliptical-has been, for almost a century, a writer of endless surprise and astonishment. The resonance and meaning embedded in her seemingly guileless wordplay (which is anything "but" guileless) still startles and astounds. Brimming with love and cunning, wit and affection Baby Precious Always Shines is Stein at her most resplendently transgressive and splendid." (Michael Bronski, author of <i>The Pleasure Principle: Sex, Backlash and the Struggle for Gay Freedom</i>) </p><p> "The love notes between Stein and Toklas, collected here by Kay Turner for the first time, offer is a glimpse into the mysteries, from the glorious to the mundane, of the Stein-Toklas marriage. The "blessed wifey" and her "little hubby" exchange kisses, caesars and cows, and they make and remake a love that speaks its name over and over again, never tiring of the repetition. Baby Precious provides a new bottom line on Stein scholarship. This slim volume will keep Stein enthusiasts busy for years."

Also included are "The Three Epochs of Modern Aesthetics and its Present Task," "Fragments for a Poetics," and two final essays discussing Goethe and H�lderlin.

The text is presented chronologically and features brief principle interpretations to provide an accessible introductory overview of an expansive subject area.</p></p><p>Preface <p> China is one of the birthplaces of civilization. Of the original civilizations, it is the only one which has continued down to the present. The civilizations of ancient Mesopotamia, Egypt, and India were all submerged or supplanted by subsequent waves of very different cultures. Chinese civilization, to be sure, was not static. It continued to evolve, but while it absorbed from outside influences, it was never wholly swamped by them. During the seventh and eighth centuries C.E., China's writing system, philosophies, and technology spread to Japan, Korea, and Vietnam, defining the area known today as East Asia. Its poetry, literature, and arts were no less influential. Today China is a nuclear power with a fifth of the world's population. Its economy is burgeoning. To understand the world today, one must understand China, and to understand China, one must understand its past. </p><p> This volume consists in the main of the China chapters of The Heritage of World Civilisations, though they have been extensively revised. It provides a chronological framework and a short narrative of China's long history. It does not neglect the ruling dynasties, but it also treats social, economic, and cultural developments that cut across dynastic lines. There exist, of course, several excellent thick histories of China. Their only drawback is that length often precludes the assignment of other readings. For the instructor who wishes to approach Chinese history topically or assign monographs, collections of documents, novels, or movies, the brevity of this text may prove an advantage. </p><p> Since brevity was a goal, the author asserts with seeming confidence many things that may be true only in the balance. Proper qualifications would take up many pages. The author has picked many key historical variables for his reconstruction of the past. In doing so, however, he has inevitably left out other variables that merit attention. Reading assignments in other works, perhaps from the bibliographies given at the end of each chapter, may provide a counterpoint to the account in the text. </p><p> Written history is an abstraction. In any society, change or stability is a consequence of the feelings and actions of hundreds of thousands or millions of people. Each person lives in a family, has social ties extending to the larger society, works for a living, and is constrained and protected by a structure of rule. The totality of such relationships shapes the actual history of a nation. The historian, at best, grasps bits and pieces of this past. In China, despite the fact that its written record in the premodern ear surpassed that of any other nation, most of the people lived in obscurity and left no traces. Writing its history from surviving sources is like doing a jigsaw puzzle with most of the pieces missing. </p><p> It is also difficult to see the past in the terms in which it saw itself. Even studying the West&#x2014;our own civilization&#x2014;we catch only glimpses of what it meant to be, say, a merchant in medieval Hamburg. What family, society, and the universe looked like to a merchant of Hangchow during the Southern Sung dynasty is even more difficult to ascertain. But some inkling may be gleaned from original sources. To this end, translations of poems, philosophy, essays, scenes from novels, and the like, are included both in the narrative and in the form of boxed quotations. The immediacy of these writings provides windows into the actual thought and feelings of the actors in China's history. They not only illuminate the history, but they remind us that Chinese living a thousand years ago had many of the same hopes, fears, joys, and sorrows that we do today. We recognize these shared feelings despite the powerful shaping of human experience by cultural modalities and social organization. </p><p> The text contains many maps. Peking in China's north is as different from Canton in the near tropical southeast as is Boston from El Paso. Most place names in the narrative may be found on the chapter maps. Also, the final section of each chapter attempts to review some of the chapter materials in a larger comparative perspective. Comparisons are useful in pointing out that similar processes occur in widely divergent societies. But the reader must remember that such similarities are usually embedded in dense structures that are quite dissimilar. Each chapter is followed by several review questions, which may be of use. The questions are followed by a short bibliography of further readings. </p><p> The author has drawn on many fine studies, his intellectual debts are legion and, as usual in a text, largely unacknowledged. But I would like to mention those to whom I owe a particular and personal debt, my first teachers in Chinese history&#x2014;Benjamin Schwartz, Edwin Reischauer, Lien-sheng Yang, and John Fairbank-and also the colleagues from whom I have learned so much over the years&#x2014;Peter Bol, Paul Cohen, Nicola DiCosmo, Merle Goldman, Philip Kuhn, Dwight Perkins, Michael Puitt, and Robin Yates. I would also like to mention my wife, Teruko Craig, who, in addition to moral support, read the manuscript many times and made valuable suggestions. Needless to say, errors in the text are my own. </p><p> Lastly, I would like to add a note on language. Until recently, most Western scholarship on Chinese history used the Wade-Giles system for the romanization of Chinese names and terms. I have used this system throughout so that students may move easily from this text to the scholarship on Chinese history listed in the bibliographies. China today, however, uses another system, known as pinyin. Virtually all Western newspapers have adopted this system, as have many scholars. For this reason, in treating Chinese history since 1949 I have included pinyin spellings in parentheses after the Wade-Giles. For example, Teng Hsiao-ping (Deng Hsiaoping). When the balance tips and the preponderance of scholarship is in pinyin, I will use it throughout.</p>A single volume, clear and manageable narrative covering all the major periods of Chinese history. The text is presented chronologically and features brief principle interpretations to provide an accessible overview of an expansive subject area. Covers a complete summary of China&#39;s history beginning with Early China, China&#39;s First Empire and Its Aftermath, Imperial China, Late Imperial China: The Ming and Ch&#39;ing Dynasties and concluding with Modern China. For anyone interested in gaining a comprehensive overview of China&#39;s vast history.</p><h2>First Peoples in a New World: Colonizing Ice Age America</h2><p>More than 12,000 years ago, in one of the greatest triumphs of prehistory, humans colonized North America, a continent that was then truly a new world. Just when and how they did so has been one of the most perplexing and controversial questions in archaeology. This dazzling, cutting-edge synthesis, written for a wide audience by an archaeologist who has long been at the center of these debates, tells the scientific story of the first Americans: where they came from, when they arrived, and how they met the challenges of moving across the vast, unknown landscapes of Ice Age North America. David J. Meltzer pulls together the latest ideas from archaeology, geology, linguistics, skeletal biology, genetics, and other fields to trace the breakthroughs that have revolutionized our understanding in recent years. Among many other topics, he explores disputes over the hemisphere&#39;s oldest and most controversial sites and considers how the first Americans coped with changing global climates. He also confronts some radical claims: that the Americas were colonized from Europe or that a crashing comet obliterated the Pleistocene megafauna. Full of entertaining descriptions of on-site encounters, personalities, and controversies, this is a compelling behind-the-scenes account of how science is illuminating our past.</p><p>"Meltzer's compelling account of the data and the debates takes readers behind the scenes of the often contentious arguments that have redirected the scientific pursuit of the first Americans."&#x2014;Tom D. Dillehay, author of <i>The Settlement of the Americas</i><br><br>"In remarkably comprehensive and lucid fashion, Meltzer synthesizes the complex and commonly conflicting evidence for the earliest human presence in the Americas and provides an honestly told lesson about the workings of scientific thought."&#x2014;David Hurst Thomas, author of <i>Skull Wars</i><br><br>"A natural storyteller, David Meltzer gives us a vivid picture of both the colonizing bands of humans who moved into the Americas and the researchers who followed their footsteps from Alaska to Chile. This is an insider's account, told with a keen eye and sense of humor, as if Meltzer were there when discoveries were made and when disputes were aired&#x2014;as, indeed, he often was."&#x2014;Ann Gibbons, author of <i>The First Human: The Race to Discover our Earliest Ancestors</i><br><br>"The settling of the Americas has been a first-rate scientific puzzle since Columbus stumbled across the peoples of the Caribbean. David Meltzer is its ideal chronicler: a major participant in the research that is unlocking the mystery and a fine writer with a wry humor. Thank goodness there aren't too many scientists like him&#x2014;science journalists like me would be out of business."&#x2014;Charles C. Mann, author of <i>1491: New Revelations of the Americas Before Columbus</i><b>David J.

Like the previous volumes, it consists of philosophical essays and exegesis.</p><p>This fourth and final volume of the monumental commentary on Wittgenstein's <i>Philosophical Investigations</i> covers pp. 428-693 of the book. Like the previous volumes, it consists of philosophical essays and exegesis. The nine essays cover all the major themes of this concluding part of Wittgenstein's masterpiece: intentionality, inductive reasoning, the arbitrariness of grammar and the bounds of sense, negation, methodology in philosophical psychology, memory and recognition, willing and the nature of voluntary action, intending, and the mythology of meaning something. Wittgenstein's writings on some of these themes have been relatively neglected, and the analytical essays on the topics of intentionality, the arbitrariness of grammar, and the will shed fresh light upon his characteristically original contributions to these subjects, which are highly relevant to current debates. The exegesis clarifies and evaluates Wittgenstein's arguments, drawing extensively on all the unpublished papers, examining the evolution of his ideas in manuscript sources and definitively settling many controversies about the interpretation of the published text. <p>This commentary, like its predecessors, is indispensable for the study of Wittgenstein and is essential reading for students of philosophy of mind and philosophy of language.</p> <p>The completion of the Commentary will be followed by a historical monograph entitled <i>Wittgenstein's Place in Twentieth Century Analytic Philosophy,</i> which will give an overview of Wittgenstein's achievement, locate his work within the mainstream of analytic philosophy and examine his influence upon the development of Cambridge analysis in the interwar years, upon the Vienna Circle and upon postwar Oxford analytic philosophy.</p><b>P.

In his canvases, radiant colors swirl, fuse, divide, recede, and float in exquisite combinations. Since the early 1960s, when he developed his unique style, Jenkins has been one of America&#39;s foremost artists. In this first full-scale volume on the artist, Albert E. Elsen, distinguished art historian and Professor of Art History at Stanford University, has drawn on Jenkins&#39;s diaries and on numerous conversations with him to create a fully rounded view of the man and his work. &#34;In writing about a living artist,&#34; he says, &#34;the historian must remind himself that he should ask questions such as those we would like to have had answered by artists of the past, before the recording of art history.&#34; While there is no subject matter in Jenkins&#39;s paintings, there is a constant search for meaning expressed within the terms of the medium itself, and for ways to paint something that is there but cannot be seen except through the experience of painting. This importance to Jenkins of conceptual content sets him apart from other contemporary colorists. Jenkins&#39;s comments on older art illuminate what he seeks to accomplish: &#34;Two kinds of light have always drawn me. The light of Georges de La Tour, which seems to radiate from the painting, and that reflected light which was most evident in Turner&#39;s imagination. From these two sources--reflection and radiation--I have tried to achieve a kind of form in its own discovered space, a kind of light which reveals itself from within, while the reflected element affirms itself from without.&#34; With 171 illustrations, including 56 hand-tipped plates in full color.</p><p></p><h2>The Three Stigmata of Palmer Eldritch (Gollancz S.F.)</h2><p>On Mars, the harsh climate could make any colonist turn to drugs to escape a dead-end existence.

Carl Trueman presents a major study of the key elements of John Owen&#39;s writings and his theology. Presenting his theology in its historical context, Trueman explores the significance of Owen&#39;s work in ongoing debates on seventeenth century theology, and examines the contexts within which Owen&#39;s theology was formulated and the shape of his mind in relation to the intellectual culture of his day - particularly in contemporary philosophy, literature and theology. Examining Owen&#39;s theology from pneumatological, political and eschatological perspectives, Trueman highlights the trinitarian structure of his theology and how his theological work informed his understanding of practical Christianity. With the current resurgence of interest in seventeenth century Reformed theology amongst intellectual historians, and the burgeoning research in systematic theology, this book presents an invaluable study of a leading mind in the Reformation and the historical underpinnings for new systematic theology.</p><p>Carl R.

Where once a visit to the shore was only a dream for many, or a once-in-a-lifetime trip for others, the varied oceanic life that has held man's interest for centuries is now just beyond the garage doors of the American family. The same curiosity that stirs the beachcombing instincts of coastal dwellers is possessed by inlanders, and now a midwesterner too can do something about that curiosity. A vacation at the shore is much within his grasp as a visit to the nearest state park. Each year more and more inland residents are taking coastal vacations. As a result beachcombing is more popular than ever, with the same old questions being repeated over and over: "What's this?" "Where do you suppose they came from?" Is that a plant or an animal?" Unfortunately, the answers in too many instances are not readily available. This book is written for the layman. It is color-coded and fully illustrated. The casual visitor of the Atlantic Coast of the United States now has an easy to use, illustrated guide for the quick identification of the marine plants along the coast.</p></p><p></p><h2>Writer&#39;s Choice Grammar and Composition Grade 9, Student Edition</h2><p>The best grammar and composition program for high school students is Glencoe&#x2019;s Writer&#x2019;s Choice.

Over half the documents made available here were discovered by the editors, including a significant group of over fifty letters that Einstein exchanged with Mileva Maric, his fellow student and future wife. These letters, together with other previously unpublished documents, provide an entirely new view of Einstein's youth. The documents in the volume also foreshadow the emergence of his extraordinary creative power. In them is manifested his intense commitment to scientific work and his interest in certain themes that proved to be central to his thinking during the next decade. We can follow, for example, the beginnings of his preoccupation with the electrodynamics of moving bodies that was to lead to the development of this special theory of relativity. For the first time it can be seen how closely he followed such contemporary developments in physics as Planck's work on radiation theory and Drude's work on the electron theory of metals. In addition to all of Einstein's known correspondence and other writings from this period, the volume includes the relevant portions of all third-party letters and other contemporary documents that provide additional information about his secondary schooling at the Aargau Cantonal School; his four years at the Swiss Federal Plytechnical School, or the ETH; and his search for a job after graduation. Included in the volume are those sections of an unpublished biography by Einstein's sister, Maja Winteler-Einstein, which deal with his early years; his extensive notes on a physics course he took at the ETH; and previously unpublished photographs of the young Einstein and his teachers and friends.</p><br><p> Documents in Volume 1 portray Einstein's experiences during the two stressful years after his graduation from the ETH in Zurich. Denied a position as an Assistant at the ETH, he lived a hand-to-mouth existence while he looked for a post at other universities; then he attempted to find a secondary-school post, and finally sought a nonacademic job. Tension with his parents over his plans to marry Mileva Maric is evident throughout this period. With the help of a friend, he finally found work at the Swiss Patent Office, the haven where he would spend the next seven years. Freed from his financial worries, he entered on one of the most productive periods of his life, as the next volume, Writings (1901-1910), will document.</p></p><p>Text: German, English, French"The volume is attractive, the editing perceptive and informative without being intrusive; the translation, an entirely appropriate and insightful compromise between the literary and the literal."

Although he was diagnosed with a neurological disease at age 21, Stephen did not let the illness define his life. Known for his groundbreaking work in physics, and identified by his wheelchair and computerized voice system, Stephen continued his research until his death in 2018. He is best known for his black hole theories and his best-selling book <i>A Brief History of Time</i>. Stephen Hawking is an example of a person who had a great mind, but an even greater spirit.</p><p>Jim Gigliotti is a writer based in Southern California. A former editor at the National Football League, he has written more than 50 books for readers of all ages, including biographies for young readers on Olympian Jesse Owens, baseball star Roberto Clemente, and musician Stevie Wonder.<b>Who Was Stephen Hawking?</b><br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> When Stephen Hawking was a young boy, he wanted a toy train more than anything else in the world. But he lived in England in the mid-1940s, during World War II. Toy makers weren&#x2019;t making toys at that time. They were too busy helping the war effort. Their factories were being used to help build planes and bombs for soldiers. Toy trains were hard to come by.<br> &nbsp;<br> So when Stephen was three years old, his father made him a wooden train. But Stephen didn&#x2019;t think of it as a <i>real</i> train. He had to push it to make it go. Then Stephen&#x2019;s father managed to find a windup train. After he turned the key, it moved on its own, but it still wasn&#x2019;t the kind of train Stephen wanted.<br> &nbsp;<br> Stephen was hoping for an electric train with real moving parts. He wanted to study how the train worked&#x2014;what made it go and what made it stop. Finally, when he was old enough, he took out all the money he had in his bank account and bought himself an electric train set. That was more like it!<br> &nbsp;<br> Stephen soon moved on to bigger things. He started building model airplanes. Then he worked on making toy boats. He didn&#x2019;t really care how they looked. Instead, he was more interested in how they worked. Sometimes he took things apart. He wasn&#x2019;t very good at putting them back together, but that didn&#x2019;t matter. He wanted to study how all the different parts worked with one another.<br> &nbsp;<br> By the time he was a teenager, Stephen started thinking about how even larger things worked&#x2014;really big things, like the universe, for instance. <i>How did it start?</i> he wondered. <i>Does it get larger? Does it get smaller? Will it ever end?</i><br> &nbsp;<br> Those are big questions! Stephen never stopped asking those big questions. Nothing could stop him. Not even a disease that kept him in a wheelchair for most of his life. Not even losing his ability to speak, and then to move at all.<br> &nbsp;<br> Instead, he overcame the challenges of his disease and became a physicist. Physics is the study of matter (what all things are made of) and energy. People who study physics take a close look at how matter and energy move through space and time.<br> &nbsp;<br> Stephen kept thinking about the big questions his entire adult life. He wrote articles and books about black holes, the origin of the universe, and all kinds of things. He was a famous scientist, an important thinker, and an inspiration to people all over the world.<br> &nbsp;<br><br> <b>Chapter 1:&nbsp;Beginnings</b><br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> When World War II began in Europe in 1939, Frank and Isobel Hawking lived in London, England. London was heavily bombed during the war by Germany, which was fighting on the other side. Many parts of the city were destroyed. The Hawkings&#x2019; home wasn&#x2019;t hit, but one bomb landed just a few houses down the street from theirs.<br> &nbsp;<br> When Isobel was pregnant with Stephen in the early 1940s, she moved for a time to Oxford, England. It was much safer in Oxford, which is about sixty miles away. Oxford is home to the University of Oxford. There were no soldiers or important factories there, so it was not a target for the Germans.<br> &nbsp;<br> In the safety of Oxford, Stephen Hawking was born on January 8, 1942. It was exactly three hundred years to the day after Italian physicist Galileo died. Stephen, who grew up to become a physicist, liked to joke that there was some significance to that. But he also admitted that thousands of other babies were born on that same day who didn&#x2019;t grow up to become famous scientists!<br> &nbsp;<br> Frank Hawking studied medicine in college and became an expert in tropical diseases. He and Isobel lived in the Highgate section of London, where many scientists lived.<br> &nbsp;<br> Stephen was Frank and Isobel&#x2019;s first child. In 1943, they had a daughter named Mary.&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> Another daughter, Philippa, was born in 1946. The family adopted a baby boy named Edward when Stephen was fourteen years old.<br> &nbsp;<br> In 1950, the family moved about twenty miles north of Highgate to Saint Albans. Frank had started an important job at the National Institute of Medical Research in Mill Hill, a town outside London. It was easier for him to commute to work from there.<br> &nbsp;<br> In Saint Albans, the Hawking family sometimes stood out from their neighbors. Eight-year-old Stephen figured it was because not as many scientists lived in Saint Albans as in Highgate. That was true, but there were probably more things that made the Hawkings stand out.<br> &nbsp;<br> For instance, they drove around town in an old London taxi from the years before the beginning of World War II. The kids were so embarrassed by the family car that they ducked down in the large spaces in the back seat so their friends wouldn&#x2019;t see them drive by! Everybody knew whose car it was, though.<br> &nbsp;<br> The Hawking family also bought an old caravan, or horse-drawn wagon. They parked it in a field in a nearby town and used it as a vacation spot. On summer holidays, the kids slept in the caravan and the grown-ups pitched an army tent right next to it.<br> &nbsp;<br> Life inside the Hawking house wasn&#x2019;t typical, either. There were books everywhere. The children even read at dinnertime.&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> The bookshelves&#x2014;and there were many&#x2014;were packed. Even when it looked like they were full, more books were shoved on top or in front of the original rows.<br> &nbsp;<br> Not surprisingly, Stephen was somewhat quiet. He played a lot on his own. Sometimes, relatives would find him staring at the sky, thinking big thoughts.<br> &nbsp;<br> But Stephen was not shy about expressing his opinions, and he made many friends. When his friends came over to the Hawking house, the family would put aside their books at dinnertime and talk instead. His young friends were very surprised at the grown-up topics they discussed, like religion or politics. The Hawking house, Stephen said, &#x201c;was a place where my mind was constantly challenged.&#x201d;</p><h2>Government and Not-for-Profit Accounting: Concepts and Practices</h2><p>The new edition of this textbook provides updates for the newest standards, along with additional projects for users to complete using Sage Software.

Jacques Le Goff describes how, as the structure of economic life inevitably began to include financial loans, the Church refashioned its ideology in order to condemn the usurer not to Hell but merely to Purgatory.

His sympathetic portrayal of White characters in his stories, in the plays The Days of the Turbins (The White Guard), which enjoyed great success at the Moscow Arts Theatre in 1926, and Flight (1927), and his satirical treatment of the officials of the New Economic Plan, led to growing criticism, which became violent after the play The Purple Island. He also wrote a brilliant biography of his literary hero, Jean-Baptiste Moli�re, but The Master and Margarita is generally considered his masterpiece. Fame, at home and abroad, was not to come until a quarter of a century after his death at Moscow in 1940.&#x201c;My favorite novel&#x2014;it&#x2019;s just the greatest explosion of imagination, craziness, satire, humor, and heart.&#x201d; &#x2014;<b>Daniel Radcliffe</b><br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;One of the truly great Russian novels of [the twentieth] century.&#x201d; &#x2014;<b><i>The New York Times Book Review</i></b><br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;By turns hilarious, mysterious, contemplative, and poignant . . .

For us, they can serve as an accessible introduction to late Neoplatonism. Olympiodorus locates the <i>First Alcibiades</i> at the start of the curriculum on Plato, because it is about self-knowledge. His pupils are beginners, able to approach the hierarchy of philosophical virtues, like the aristocratic playboy Alcibiades. Alcibiades needs to know himself, at least as an individual with particular actions, before he can reach the virtues of mere civic interaction. As Olympiodorus addresses mainly Christian students, he tells them that the different words they use are often symbols of truths shared between their faiths.</p><p>A translation of Olympiodorus' commentary on Plato's <i>First Alcibiades</i> accompanied by extensive commentary notes, introduction and indexes.<p><b>Olympiodorus</b> (AD <i>c</i>. 500&#x2013;570 CE) was one of the latest non-Christian teachers of pagan philosophy in Alexandria.</p><p><b>Michael Griffin</b> is Assistant Professor of Classics and Philosophy at the University of British Columbia, Vancouver, Canada.</p></p><h2>Diagramming Techniques for Analysis and Programmers</h2><p>First edition.

It argues that this was the view of humility that put Christian moral thought into decisive conflict with the best Greco-Roman moral thought. This radical Christian account of humility has been forgotten amidst contemporary efforts to clarify and retrieve the virtue of humility for secular life. Kent Dunnington shows how humility was repurposed during the early-modern era-particularly in the thought of Hobbes, Hume, and Kant-to better serve the economic and social needs of the emerging modern state. This repurposed humility insisted on a role for proper pride alongside humility, as a necessary constituent of self-esteem and a necessary motive of consistent moral action over time. Contemporary philosophical accounts of humility continue this emphasis on proper pride as a counterbalance to humility. By contrast, radical Christian humility proscribes pride altogether. Dunnington demonstrates how such a radical view need not give rise to vices of humility such as servility and pusillanimity, nor need such a view fall prey to feminist critiques of humility. But the view of humility set forth makes little sense abstracted from a specific set of doctrinal commitments peculiar to Christianity. This study argues that this is a strength rather than a weakness of the account since it displays how Christianity matters for the shape of the moral life.<br></p><p><br>Kent Dunnington, <em>Associate Professor of Philosophy, Biola University</em><br><br>Kent Dunnington is Associate Professor of Philosophy at Biola University.

In an attempt to reverse this trend, Professor Ceaser discusses the theories of selection offered by leading American statesmen from the Founders and Thomas Jefferson to Martin Van Buren and Woodrow Wilson. From these theories he identifies a set of criteria for a sound selection system that he then uses to analyze and evaluate the recent changes in the selection process.</p><br><p> Five normative functions of a presidential selection system comprise the author's criteria: it should minimize the harmful effects of ambitious contenders for the office, promote responsible executive leadership and power, help secure an able president, ensure a legitimate accession, and provide for an appropriate amount of choice and change.</p><br><p> Professor Ceaser finds that the present system is characterized by weak parties and candidate-centered campaigns that lead to the problems of "image" politics and demagogic leadership appeals. He therefore argues for a more republican selection system in which political parties would be strengthened to serve as a restraining force on popular authority, public opinion, and individual aspirations for executive power.</p></p><p></p><h2>The Theatre of Grotowski (Performance Books)</h2><p><p>First published in 1985, this is a reissue of the seminal text on the work of Jerzy Grotowski and Laboratory Theatre recognized as being one of the most influential and important studies of the Polish theatre practitioner.</p><p>In 1984 Grotowski's Laboratory Theatre closed down after twenty-five years of ceaseless experimentation pushing at the boundaries of the nature of theatre.

A revolutionary reformer who traveled in Scotland, Ireland, England, and Wales as well as the US, Douglass published many foreign-language editions of his <em>Narrative</em>. While there have been many Douglasses over the decades and even centuries, the Frederick Douglass we need now is no iconic, mythic, or legendary self-made man but a fallible, mortal, and human individual: a husband, father, brother, and son.

Agitate!&#x201d; </p> <p>Recognizing that Douglass was bought and sold on the northern abolitionist podium no less than on the southern auction block, this edition introduces readers to Douglass&#x2019;s multiple declarations of independence. The <em>Narrative</em> appears alongside his private correspondence as well as the early speeches and writings in which he did justice to the &#x201c;grim horrors of slavery.&#x201d; This volume also traces Douglass&#x2019;s activism and authorship in the context of the reformist work of his wife, Anna Murray, and of his daughters and sons. </p></p><p><p><strong>Celeste-Marie Bernier</strong> is Professor of Black Studies at the University of Edinburgh. </p><p>&#x201c;The 2018 Broadview edition of Douglass&#x2019;s <em>Narrative</em> could not be timelier.

In words and images, Bernier&#x2019;s Douglass&#x2015;autobiographer, orator, bookseller, family man, fugitive&#x2015;cuts a bold black figure.

Levine, Distinguished University Professor, University of Maryland, and author of <em>The Lives of Frederick Douglass</em> </p> <p>&#x201c;Bernier&#x2019;s edition of Frederick Douglass&#x2019;s <em>Narrative</em> will immediately establish its place as the most original and timely version of the great black abolitionist&#x2019;s bestselling text. Without romanticizing Douglass, Bernier uncovers his skills as a self-reflective writer and experimental autobiographer and contextualizes his work within survivor narratives written by slaves and former slaves throughout the Atlantic world. Bernier&#x2019;s edition of the <em>Narrative</em> is <em>the</em> text for twenty-first-century readers.

But his book is also a plea for <i>more serious</i> fieldwork, based on a methodology that is distinctively (though not uniquely) anthropological. In its own way, then, this book is a gauntlet thrown down to challenge familiar ways of knowing. Its innovativeness rests partly upon urging us to do what we had been doing before--but to do it more thoroughly, more honestly. Trouillot's gift for sketching an emergent synthesis, which draws repeatedly on the asking of harder questions, comes through. Above all, he makes us <i>think</i>."--Sidney W.

The underlying concepts and world-views of indigenous and contemporary shamanism are compared, contrasted and tied in with current developments in psychology, physics and neuro-science. After clarifying altered states of perception, concepts of integrative wholeness of mind, body, soul and spirit and transformative shamanic healing approaches, the book discloses how indigenous traditions can be adjusted for contemporary practice. It offers practitioners a highly effective repertoire of insights, psycho-spiritual approaches and step-by-step therapeutic tools and techniques, illustrated with examples and case studies throughout. This inspirational book is essential reading for psychologists, therapists, counsellors and coaches looking for profound insights and innovative methods of practice that cater for the whole human psyche, reaching beyond contemporary Western mind and body approaches.

If you haven't read it recently, though, you may not remember the sweeping force of the prose, the grotesque, surreal imagery, and the multilayered <i>doppelg�nger</i> themes of Mary Shelley's masterpiece. As fantasy writer Jane Yolen writes of this (the reviewer's favorite) edition, "The strong black and whites of the main text [illustrations] are dark and brooding, with unremitting shadows and stark contrasts. But the central conversation with the monster--who owes nothing to the overused movie image ... but is rather the novel's charnel-house composite--is where [Barry] Moser's illustrations show their greatest power ... The viewer can all but smell the powerful stench of the monster's breath as its words spill out across the page. Strong book-making for one of the world's strongest and most remarkable books."

In the hours, days, weeks and months that followed, news of the battle would begin to shape the consciousness of an age; the battlegrounds would be looted and cleared, its dead buried or burned, its ground and ruins overrun by voyeuristic tourists; the victorious British and Prussian armies would invade France and occupy Paris. And as his enemies within and without France closed in, Napoleon saw no avenue ahead but surrender, exile and captivity. In this dramatic account of the aftermath of the battle of Waterloo, Paul O&#39;Keeffe employs a multiplicity of contemporary sources and viewpoints to create a reading experience that brings into focus as never before the sights, sounds, and smells of the battlefield, of conquest and defeat, of celebration and riot.</p><p><b>Paul O'Keeffe</b> is a lecturer and writer.

Yet Guant�namo is more than a U.S. naval base and prison in Cuba, it is a town, and our military occupation there has required more than soldiers and sailors&#x2015;it has required workers. This revealing history of the women and men who worked on the U.S. naval base in Guant�namo Bay tells the story of U.S.-Cuban relations from a new perspective, and at the same time, shows how neocolonialism, empire, and revolution transformed the lives of everyday people. Drawing from rich oral histories and little-explored Cuban archives, Jana K. Lipman analyzes how the Cold War and the Cuban revolution made the naval base a place devoid of law and accountability. The result is a narrative filled with danger, intrigue, and exploitation throughout the twentieth century. Opening a new window onto the history of U.S. imperialism in the Caribbean and labor history in the region, her book tells how events in Guant�namo and the base created an ominous precedent likely to inform the functioning of U.S. military bases around the world.</p><p>"Engaging and eye-opening to anyone interested in Guant�namo's current role, American imperialism, Caribbean history, working-class politics, or gender in international affairs."&#x2015;Cynthia Enloe, author of <i>Globalization and Militarism </i><br><br>"A compelling example of why good diplomatic history needs to also be social history (and vice versa)."&#x2015;Greg Grandin, author of <i>Empire's Workshop </i><b>Jana K.

In it he played on certain latent terrors that are part of man&#39;s nature in all kinds of societies and at all epochs; terrors whose influence may pervade our lives in ways we scarcely guess ...&#39; These words come from the introduction to Dr Dawe&#39;s edition of Oedipus Rex. In an attempt to analyse why this play &#39;...has exercised such a powerful and long-lasting fascination on the human mind&#39; Dr Dawe devotes his introduction to an examination of the content of the story and to the technique displayed by Sophocles in the unfolding of the plot. The commentary deals authoritatively with problems of language and expression. This is an edition for classical scholars, undergraduates, and students in the upper forms of schools.

Beginning with coverage of background material, including references to pertinent research, the development of specific formulas used in the AISC Specifications is followed by a generous number of design examples explaining in detail the process of selecting minimum weight members to satisfy given conditions. </p></p><p><p> Appropriate for civil engineering courses in structural steel design, the fourth edition of this classic text provides background for designing steel structural elements using the 1993 AISC Load and Resistance Factor Design (LRFD) and the 1989 AISC Allowable Stress Design (ASD) Specifications. As in previous successful editions, a logical sequence of topics is featured, making complex material easy to understand. Emphasis throughout is placed on the explanation of the LRFD approach involving "limit states" and factored loads. To provide secondary coverage for the major topics--such as tension members, axially loaded columns, beams, beam-columns, and composite construction--the ASD formulations are developed from the strength-related concepts of LRFD. Throughout the book, all concepts are illustrated by numerical examples using LRFD; for the most important concepts, examples using ASD are also included.

Successive chapters focus on anatomy, showing action and typical behaviors, creating the right habitat for the animal, painting realistic colors and textures and tips on composition. Finally, all of these techniques are brought together in a complete painting demonstration. Throughout, step-by-step mini demos facilitate the artist&#39;s comprehension and mastery of the technique. Cynthie Fisher has been a full-time wildlife artist for 12 years, and the winner of six state duck stamp contests. She is a member of the Society of Animal Artists and has designed three different series of collector plates.</p><p>Cynthie Fisher brings her passions for zoology, taxidermy, and big game and bird hunting to her book about how to paint deer, elk, moose, and other hooved animals. After a brief introduction to materials, Fisher suggests sources for study and emphasizes the need for sketching: "The number one piece of advice is sketch, sketch, sketch! If you can create a good representation of an animal through your own observation and freehand talent, there is no limit to the creativity and enjoyment you can derive from painting." An anatomy primer examines a selection of popular species and describes how hooved animals are built. The bulk of the book zeroes in on specific species: white-tailed deer; mule deer; elk; moose, caribou, sheep and antelope; and other hooved animals. Each of these chapters includes brief painting demonstrations. The final chapter illustrates how to create finished paintings in acrylic and includes two complete step-by-step demonstrations of whitetails in a forest and elk in the snow. Fisher possesses an impressive mastery of her subject, and her paintings sometimes resemble photographs in vividness of detail and natural light. From the majestic golden curves of a Marco Polo sheep's horns against a steep snow-covered mountainside to the bold stripes of zebras set amidst a shimmering yellow plain, Fisher brings the drama, nobility, and grace of hooved animals exquisitely to life. <i>--Mary Ribeski</i>The books in this North Light series fill an important niche in wildlife painting, but they vary in usefulness. Johnson, a professional artist for a dozen years, proves an excellent teacher. Her firm grasp of structure and anatomy brings to life deer, elk, moose, caribou, sheep, and antelope. Her use only of acrylics may limit the appeal of the book, and it may need to be supplemented by books like Doug Lindstrand's Drawing Big Game: An Artist's Reference Guide to the North's Great Animals (reviewed below) and Rod Lawrence's Painting Wildlife Textures Step by Step (LJ 3/15/97). Lawrence, a professional artist with many prestigious awards to his credit, has become one of the better instructors of wildlife art. His Wildlife Painting Basics: Waterfowl &amp; Wading Birds is a visually sumptuous book that covers body shapes, proportions, and anatomy in detail. Demonstrating in watercolors, acrylics, and oils, Lawrence poses his subjects standing, walking, swimming, feeding, or flying. Good sections on painting plumage and background flora round out the volume.

Her inner-city Chicago elementary school fades to black as the lunch lady strikes an arabesque or a struggling student performs the dance of the dying swan, all set to her interior soundtrack. (Tina Turner's "Funkier Than a Mosquita's Tweeter" echoes whenever her idea-stealing, dimwitted principal harangues her.) She's a rash, petite, white lady who roller-skates through the halls and insists that her fifth-graders call her "Madame Esm�." But it's not all fun and games: she introduces us to children who fling their desks and apologize in tears, and at one point, after reporting a disruptive student to her mother, who subsequently thrashes the young girl, she dry heaves into her classroom's trash can. <p> Codell's 24-year-old voice is loud and clear ("Serious gross out," she writes after the scorned principal hugs her), though, on the principle that kids say the darnedest things, she often simply repeats their comments for comic effect. She's got sass, maybe too much self-confidence at times, and though there's no deep introspection in <i>Educating Esm�</i>, you'll be convinced her 10-year-old charges emerge the better for knowing her. <i>--Jodi Mailander Farrell</i></p>"A pop culture phenomenon" (<i>Publishers Weekly</i>)<p> "Screaming funny" (<i>Booklist</i>)</p><p> "Funny, poignant, and even sad. You'll find yourself laughing at places, ready to cry at others." (<i>The Arizona Republic</i>)</p><p> "It should be read by anyone who's interested in the future of public education." (<i>Boston Phoenix Literary Section</i>)</p><p> "Esme is a teacher I'd hire tomorrow. There is nothing the profession needs more than such creative intelligent, combative, and loving teachers." ( Herbert Kohl, author of <i>36 Children</i>)</p><p> Esme Raji Codell has come to teach. Fresh-mouthed and miniskirted, this irrepressible spirit does the cha-cha during multiplication lessons, roller-skates down the hallways, and puts on rousing performances with at-risk students in the library. In <i>Educating Esme</i>, the diary of her first year teaching in a Chicago public school, she opens a window into a real-life classroom. While battling bureaucrats, gang members, abusive parents, and her own insecurities, this gifted teacher changes her student's lives forever.</p><p> Winner, Memoir of the Year, ForeWord magazine</p><p> Winner, Alex Award for Outstanding Book for Young Adult Readers</p><p></p></p><h2>Principles of Cartography</h2><p>Principles of Cartography (Geography</p><p></p><h2>Classics of Philosophy: Volume II: Modern and Contemporary (Classics of Philosophy)</h2><p><em>Classics of Philosophy: Volume II, Modern and Contemporary</em> covers the works of philosophers from Descartes to Rawls.

By integrating methodology and course content descriptions with student writings and analyses of students&#x2019; growth, the book highlights the interaction between teaching and learning.

He argues that the use of such records reveals not only the nature of sexual behaviour that was considered criminal, but also what society established as the norm. Through this examination of illicit sexuality, Ruggiero sheds light on the institutions, languages, social life and values not only of this shadow-culture, but also of Venetian society and, ultimately, the Renaissance itself.</p><p>Guido Ruggiero is at University of Connecticut.<br>"Extremely welcome for its systematic attempt to squeeze information about changing attitudes to sexuality from the judicial records."--<em>The London Review of Books</em><p></p><br>"As full a picture as can be constructed from the scraps of legal and other documents which reveal the Venetian attitudes towards women and sexuality, sex crime and sexual deviance in the Renaissance."--<em>Chronique</em><p></p><br>"[An] excellent case history."--<em>Sex Roles</em><p></p><br></p><h2>The Shorter Oxford English Dictionary (Plain)</h2><p>An abridgement of The Oxford English Dictionary that provides information on current literary, scientific, and colloquial terms as well as obsolete words</p><p></p><h2>The Rice Room: Growing Up Chinese-American from Number Two Son to Rock &#39;n&#39; Roll</h2><p>An instant best-seller when originally published in 1994, this expanded and updated edition of <i>The Rice Room</i> tells of growing up with a double identity&#x2015;Chinese and American.

By focusing on Mt. Miwa in present-day Nara Prefecture and examining the worship of indigenous deities (<i>kami</i>) that emerged in its proximity, this book serves as a case study of the key stages of &#x201c;assemblage&#x201d; through which this formative process took shape. Previously unknown rituals, texts, and icons featuring kami, all of which were invented in medieval Japan under the strong influence of esoteric Buddhism, are evaluated using evidence from local and translocal ritual and pilgrimage networks, changing land ownership patterns, and a range of religious ideas and practices. These stages illuminate the medieval pedigree of Ry&#x14d;bu Shint&#x14d; (kami ritual worship based loosely on esoteric Buddhism&#x2019;s Two Mandalas), a major precursor to modern Shinto.</p><p>In analyzing the key mechanisms for &#x201c;assembling&#x201d; medieval forms of kami worship, Andreeva challenges the twentieth-century master narrative of Shinto as an unbroken, monolithic tradition. By studying how and why groups of religious practitioners affiliated with different cultic sites and religious institutions responded to esoteric Buddhism&#x2019;s teachings, this book demonstrates that kami worship in medieval Japan was a result of complex negotiations.</p></p><p>Anna Andreeva is a Research Fellow at the Cluster of Excellence &#x201c;Asia and Europe in a Global Context,&#x201d; Karl Jaspers Centre for Advanced Transcultural Studies, Ruprecht-Karls-Universit�t Heidelberg.</p><h2>Poor No More</h2><p>In the 1960s, America set out to end poverty. Policy-makers put forth an unprecedented package of legislation, funding poverty programs and empowering the poor through ineffectual employment-related education and training. However, these handouts produced little change, and efforts to provide education and job-training proved inconsequential, boasting only a 2.8 percent decrease in the poverty rate since 1965. Decades after the War on Poverty began, many of its programs failed. Only one thing really worked to help end poverty-and that was work itself, the centerpiece of welfare reform in 1996.&nbsp; Poor No More is a plan to restructure poverty programs, prioritizing jobs above all else. Traditionally, job placement programs stemmed from non-profit organizations or government agencies. However, America Works, the first for-profit job placement venture founded by Peter Cove, has the highest employee retention rate in the greater New York City area, even above these traditional agencies. When the federal government embraced the work-first ideal, inspired by the success of America Works, welfare rolls plummeted from 12.6 million to 4.7 million nationally within one decade. <em>Poor No More</em> is a paradigm-shifting work that guides the reader through the evolution of America's War on Poverty and urges policy-makers to eliminate training and education programs that waste time and money and to adopt a work-first model, while providing job-seekers with the tools and life lessons essential to finding and maintaining employment.</p><p><p><em>Peter Cove</em>&nbsp;has spent over half a century fighting poverty in America. He is the founder of America Works, the first for-profit, welfare-to-work company.

Both tend toward support for work first, but in different ways. I can't think of another case where someone who initially shared Great Society views of poverty came to different and more conservative conclusions based on program experience. And this occurred independently of the research, which was going the same way. It's crucial that Cove didn't begin as a conservative, as many critics of social policy do. He also still preserves a commitment to helping the poor, such as liberals claim for themselves.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x2014;Lawrence M.

Routledge is an imprint of Taylor &amp; Francis, an informa company.</p><p><strong>Bennett Alan Weinberg</strong> is a medical and science writer. He is also chairman of his own advertising and public relations firm whose clients include several of the world's leading pharmaceutical companies.<br><strong>Bonnie K.</strong> <strong>Bealer</strong> is a researcher and writer trained in psychology and anthropology. The authors live in Philadelphia.This book covers the history and social effects of the principal beverages that contain caffeine, notably coffee and tea. Products of cacao, chocolate that is eaten and drunk, and the soft drinks that contain caffeine (principally colas) are also covered. The historical origins of coffee, tea, and cacao are described, as are the various fascinating ways they made their way into world culture. Some of the main features of this story are told with a theme of geographic spread and with a description of effects of the arrival of "the drug," as the authors often refer to caffeine, on existing cultures. How the different beverages were received (or rejected) by different cultures and by different strata and segments of each culture makes a rich and exciting story. Insights emerge as to how the various civilizations worked. The pleasure of reading is enhanced by the authors' eye for beauty and the many appropriate half-tone illustrations. The scholarship is impressive; many of the most famous figures of the past 500 and more years make brief appearances. Among them are Chinese emperors, Zen Buddhist monks in Japan, nameless Olmecs of Mesoamerica, and then Cortes and Montezuma and Charles V. The conquest of Europe by the drug from Turkish and African sources is also covered. The familiar names of great historical figures appear on almost every page, tying this account in with our knowledge of history and making it more real. The text is rich with information, yet it is easy and pleasant to read. <p> Social factors are discussed. For example, there are comparisons of the tea culture of England with that of Japan and comparisons of both with the coffee culture of the United States. The duality of the culture of coffee (as in coffee houses) and the culture of tea (as in tea shops, tea gardens, and afternoon tea) is emphasized and illustrated with a list of more than 30 word pairs. One word in each pair is labeled the "coffee aspect" and the other the "tea aspect." The list of coffee aspects starts with "male," "boisterous," and "bohemian" and ends with "Balzac," whereas the list of tea aspects starts with "female," "decorous," and "conventional" and ends with "Proust." Cola beverages are said not to have a long enough history to have features as well differentiated as these, but they do have distinctive associations, such as "youth, high energy, America, pop culture, and `good clean fun."' Although the authors emphasize that all these popular beverages contain the drug caffeine, the diversity of the cultures associated with the different beverages suggests that caffeine is only one factor leading to their consumption. </p><p> True to its title, the book has little to say about alcohol, but the authors do make the important point that, at least in Europe and North America and at least in the large towns, raw water was not fit to drink until late in the 19th century. The increase in tea and coffee drinking offered an alternative to the usual beverages: beer, gin, and rum. The authors credibly associate this shift with a decrease in alcohol intake, to the benefit of society. </p><p> In the second half of the book, the nature of the story changes. The urbane historical perspective gives way to more recent concerns, including a discussion of what might be called huckstering by purveyors of caffeine products. Almost the final third of the book is devoted to the chemistry, pharmacology, and medical aspects of caffeine. I do not think that in a book of this size it is possible to present enough of an understanding for readers to reach their own conclusions on adequate grounds about the health and safety aspects of caffeine, and in many instances the original sources must be scrutinized for the adequacy of the evidence. In addition, there are errors. For example, a woman is said to have had a serum caffeine concentration of almost 300 mg per milliliter, which is many times the solubility of caffeine. Readers can remain confused, they can accept the often implicit conclusions of the writers, or they can opt out and simply trust the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). </p><p> A number of minor matters follow. Pure caffeine is variously described as "highly toxic" or "extremely toxic." An agent that can be ingested in amounts of several grams with relative impunity would not customarily be considered very toxic. A number of common foods -- dry mustard, horseradish, or cayenne pepper, for instance -- would not go down well as boluses of several grams. The poison of the puffer fish, whose flesh is eaten in Japan, is highly toxic, being hazardous in quantities thousands of times smaller than ordinarily consumed quantities of caffeine. </p><p> Finally, the authors aver that the International Life Sciences Institute (ILSI) was founded to help forestall efforts to regulate caffeine. But the FDA was regulating caffeine long before the ILSI was formed. The Caffeine Technical Committee of the ILSI was formed by interested companies to sponsor research on questions on caffeine raised by the FDA and others. It is prohibited from lobbying. </p><p> <i>Peter B. Dews, M.B., Ch.B., Ph.D.</i> <br>Copyright � 2001 Massachusetts Medical Society. All rights reserved.

Woolls and Loertscher are internationally known school librarianship educators. Since this is an ALA publication, the articles selected draw from the periodicals of the association and its youth divisions. Two ABC-CLIO periodicals (Woolls is a consulting editor for Libraries Unlimited), Canada&#x2019;s Teacher Librarian (which Loertscher used to edit), a couple of state school library periodicals, and School Library Journal round out the list. Surprisingly, Booklist and VOYA were not included. The 63 articles vary in length from one-half page to seven pages. Most articles are excerpts, although it is not apparent the extent of those selected parts. The articles are clustered into nine topics: the profession, collection development, evaluation, technology, operations, programming (mainly reading promotion), advocacy, underserved populations (mainly students with disabilities), and contemporary issues (mainly legal issues). The volume is more of a sampler than a systematic, exhaustive collection in terms of topics (e.g., one tribute, one author article), but it is disappointing not to see reference&#x2013;information services, multiculturalism, or more statistics.

This new edition of <i>Squire&#x2019;s Fundamentals of Radiology</i> describes and illustrates these new techniques to prepare medical students and other radiology learners to provide the most optimal and up-to-date imaging management for their patients. Not only are new diagnostic techniques outlined, such as the multidetector computed tomography diagnosis of pulmonary embolism and the diffusion-weighted magnetic-resonance imaging of stroke, but hundreds of new diagnostic images have been included to illustrate the radiological characteristics of common diseases with state-of-the-art computed radiography, ultrasound, multidetector computed tomography, and magnetic-resonance images. The text has been completely reviewed and updated to present the latest and best strategies in diagnostic imaging.<br>New interventional radiology procedures have been added, including vertebroplasty, a percutaneous injection treatment of painful spinal compression fractures; uterine artery embolization, a surgical alternative to hysterectomy in women with painful or bleeding uterine fibroids; and radiofrequency ablation, a percutaneous technique for treating unresectable tumors in the liver and other organs with probes that superheat and thus destroy cancer cells.<br>A new chapter on advances in diagnostic imaging describes many cutting-edge imaging technologies, such as three-dimensional and digital imaging, functional magnetic-resonance imaging, PET&#x2013;CT (positron emission tomography combined with computed tomography), cardiac calcium CT scoring, multidetector gated cardiac CT, and molecular imaging.</p><p>Robert A. Novelline, M.D., is Professor Emeritus of Radiology at Harvard Medical School and Director Emeritus of both the Harvard Medical School Core and Advanced Radiology Student Clerkships at Massachusetts General Hospital.&#x201c;[Review of the previous edition] As a result of wide popularity, this excellent textbook reaches its fifth edition. The book appears to have been and to be the 'vademecum' of thousands of medical students, but its content is also devoted to doctors of sciences other than radiology, who use imaging as an essential tool for diagnostic workup of patients. The 25 years' experience of the textbook can clearly be recognized through its 20 chapters covering all fields of diagnostic imaging. The significant advances in imaging technology have brought a great number of new diagnostic images to this edition and new subjects, such as interventional radiology, have been included. Another important new feature of the book is body anatomy, explained either by plain films or by cross-sectional images. All diagnostic problems are presented in a very practical and essential way, tailored to students who will certainly be doctors but may not become radiologists. The reasoning of the author as a non-radiologist but with the radiologist's eyes is the most captivating feature of the textbook. This aspect can only be explained by Squire's and then Novelline's great experience in teaching medical students... The quality of images and captions is excellent, mainly from the teaching point of view. In fact, I was unable to find any misleading image or caption. Although the book is primarily devoted to medical students, its characteristics make it suitable also for first-/second-year residents in radiology. The book is definitely to be recommended to all doctors willing to know more about modern diagnostic imaging. Its size and reasonable price make this volume highly cost-effective.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>A. Chiesa</b><b>, </b><b><i>European Radiology</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;[Review of the previous edition] This is the fifth edition of a text...written as an introduction to radiology for medical students. In 1964 Lucy Frank Squire authored the first edition, which became a standard for education of medical students. Squire recently passed away, but her teaching enthusiasm and spirit are maintained in eloquent fashion by Novelline, her colleague and friend. Without changing its purpose, the text has been rewritten considerably and is nearly doubled in size. New chapters in anatomy and subspecialty areas are included. New to this edition are chapters emphasizing primary-care areas, including women's imaging, men's imaging, pediatric radiology, and AIDS. This edition also contains photographs of patients undergoing exams in radiology suites and discussions of the patients' experiences in the department.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b><i>Booklist</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;Five stars! Dr. Novelline has done an incredible job, taking an excellent text and improving it.

Basing his work on a two-year analysis of the company done during the closing years of World War II, Drucker looks at the General Motors managerial organization from within. He tries to understand what makes the company work so effectively, what its core principles are, and how they contribute to its successes. The themes this volume addresses go far beyond the business corporation, into a consideration of the dynamics of the so-called corporate state itself.</p> <p>When the book initially appeared, General Motors managers rejected it as unfairly critical and antibusiness. Yet, the GM concept of the corporation and its principles of organization later became models for organizations worldwide. Not only businesses, but also government agencies, research laboratories, hospitals, and universities have found in <em>Concept of the Corporation</em> a basis for effective organization and management.</p> <p>Because it offers a fundamental theory of corporate goals, this book is a valuable resource for business professionals and organization analysts. It will also be of interest to students and professionals in economics, public administration, and political science.

In this &#34;Who&#39;s Who&#34; of crime, readers will find the full flavor and substance of Mafia culture, customs, and characters presented in more than 400 articles. More than ninety-five black-and-white photographs help capture Mafia history from the birth of the brotherhood and the major underworld figures who created it, to the law enforcement agents and organizations who have triedand failedto destroy it. The Mafia Encyclopedia includes biographical entries of both well- and less well-known wise guys, their criminal specialties, career highlights, friends and enemies, eccentricities, peccadilloes, and frequently dramatic demises.</p><p>They're all there, starting with Anthony Joseph Accardo (1906-1992), the Chicago mob leader known as Tony to crime pals, Mr. Accardo to underlings, Joe Batters to his subordinates, and as "having more brains before breakfast than Al Capone had all day" to syndicate supporters, and working through the alphabet to Abner "Longy" Zwillman (1899-1959), a crime-syndicate founder and New Jersey boss, one of the most feared of the Jewish Mafia, known as the "Al Capone of new Jersey," and much revered for his love affair with Jean Harlow.<p> Between Accardo and Zwillman, Carl Sifakis explores the lives, reputations, exploits, and subcultures of more than 450 Mafia perpetrators and personalities. Sifakis describes the individuals, codes of behavior, misdeeds, legal scrapes, rivalries, and flamboyant lifestyles associated with the world of organized crime--an entity whose existence J.&nbsp;Edgar Hoover denied for 30 years. Sifakis's research is thorough, and his subjects are nefarious and riveting. It's his feel for storytelling, however, that makes his encyclopedia so enjoyable. He writes about infamous characters such as Al Capone (who felt his bootlegging was merely a public service) and John Gotti (a.k.a. the Teflon Don, who's now serving a life sentence) as well as the Mafia Social Clubs, Donnie Brasco (the FBI agent who infiltrated the mob and sent more than 100 mobsters to prison), and the importance of slot machines to the post-Prohibition welfare of organized crime.</p><p> With nearly 100 pictures and illustrations, Sifakis's mob opus is required reading for Mafia buffs, and a remarkably engaging guide for anyone interested in a factual report on organized crime. <i>--Stephanie Gold</i></p>Carl Sifakis is a crime reporter and freelance writer.

Drawing on science and technology studies, feminist theory, and historical and ethnographic analyses of ART clinics, Charis Thompson explores the intertwining of biological reproduction with the personal, political, and technological meanings of reproduction. She analyzes the "ontological choreography" at ART clinics&#x2015;the dynamics by which technical, scientific, kinship, gender, emotional, legal, political, financial, and other matters are coordinated&#x2015;using ethnographic data to address questions usually treated in the abstract. Reproductive technologies, says Thompson, are part of the increasing tendency to turn social problems into biomedical questions and can be used as a lens through which to see the resulting changes in the relations between science and society.</p><p>After giving an account of the book's disciplinary roots in science and technology studies and in feminist scholarship on reproduction, Thompson comes to the ethnographic heart of her study. She develops her concept of ontological choreography by examining ART's normalization of "miraculous" technology (including the etiquette of technological sex); gender identity in the assigned roles of mother and father and the conservative nature of gender relations in the clinic; the naturalization of technologically assisted kinship and procreative intent; and patients' pursuit of agency through objectification and technology. Finally, Thompson explores the economies of reproductive technologies, concluding with a speculative and polemical look at the "biomedical mode of reproduction" as a predictor of future relations between science and society.</p></p><p>"This is brilliant work! Charis Thompson gives us an innovative masterpiece, rethinking reproduction in an age defined by the promises, processes, and consequences of current and developing technoscientific enmeshments. Standing at the trafficked intersection of brave new technical worlds, anguished individual/familial/gendered yearnings, the odd tensions of consumer responsibility, and the commodification of life itself, Thompson reports back with a stunning range of vision, helping us address the new complexities that constitute reproduction in the West today. This book belongs on everybody's shelves." --Adele E. Clarke, University of California, San Francisco <p>"This book is magisterial in its reach. It will be an extremely significant contribution to our understanding of reproductive technologies, and its commanding writing style matches its ambition. It is a sort of dream book: everything one could expect from an early twenty-first-century work of serious scholarship born out of the last thirty years of debates and reconceptualizations of gender relations, new technologies, ethics, and science." --Marilyn Strathern, Department of Social Anthropology, University of Cambridge </p><p>"Thompson's 'ontological choreography' underscores the ways in which parents are 'remade' through the processes of assisted reproductive technology, and shows how the very conception of the human is historically recast as a result of these new technological conditions for the reproduction of life. One of this extraordinary book's chief strengths is that it returns a set of abstract debates about ethics, technology, and personhood to specific institutional settings, showing us how such dilemmas emerge and giving them a much-needed historical specificity. This is a wide-ranging, unprecedented, incisive, and brilliant inquiry, probing and provocative, and bound to change the field for years to come." --Judith Butler, author of Undoing Gender and Precarious Life: The Power of Mourning and Violence </p><p>"Charis Thompson's Making Parents is an extraordinary account of an extraordinary aspect of our world: the technological, legal, and moral complexities of becoming a parent in the twnety-first century. Throughout, Thompson maintains a wonderful double vision: seeing as a remarkably gifted, scientifically informed ethnographer and watching anxious and hopeful doctors, nurses, and would-be parents with compassion and self-reflection. It is, to be sure, a book that draws deeply on science studies and feminism, but it carries that work to new spaces and in new directions. It is an added and unusual bonus that she delivers the scholarship with grace, humor, and sparkle." --Peter Galison, Mallinckrodt Professor of the History of Science and of Physics, Harvard University</p>Charis Thompson is Associate Professor of Rhetoric and Women's Studies at the University of California, Berkeley.

In eloquent prose, it gracefully models the act of paying attention.

"Alan Jacobs is, quite simply, one of our most discerning cultural critics. He writes with a flair and elegance, combined with vibrant faith, that makes his essays an instructive delight. This is an important book."<p>-Richard John Neuhaus, editor in chief, First Things "Wise, witty, winsome-these 'moral essays' by Alan Jacobs reflect upon and use the tradition of the literary essay to invite serious thought about how to live. Read them in bed or in an easy chair, while eating or while traveling, but expect to be gently yet firmly provoked to thought about how we live today." -Gilbert Meilaender, Valparaiso University</p>In A Visit to Vanity Fair, Alan Jacobs reminds us that "our ordinariness and our finitude do not sanction moral indifference or the refusal to practice, publicly when necessary, moral discernment." <p>If indeed we were created to "look at this world with a happy eye, but from a sober perspective," as W. H. Auden suggests, then Alan Jacob shows us exactly how to do so. These perceptive moral essays crackle with wit, intelligence, and a wide range of knowledge.

It was a marvelously eclectic period noted for an undisciplined exuberance and unlimited riches made possible by the emerging Industrial Revolution.<br>With stunning new photography of magnificent period houses, most open to the public and many never before published, Victorian America: From Classical Romanticism to Gilded Opulence presents the finest examples of Victorian American architecture and decorative arts from the 1850s, through the Civil War, and into the turn of the century.<br>Here are authentic and spectacular Victorian interiors as seen in the Putnam-Balch House of Salem, Massachusetts, Wilson Castle of Proctor, Vermont, Victorian Mansion of Portland, Maine, the Bush House of Salem, Oregon, the Theodore Roosevelt Birthplace in New York City, Rosedown in Louisiana, Vizcaya in Miami, the Hermitage in Tennessee, the Pabst Mansion in Milwaukee, and the Villa Finale in San Antonio, among other great houses.<br>Author Wendell Garrett, noted American historian and former editor of the magazine Antiques, presents perceptive and knowledgeable descriptions of the houses, their interiors, and their furnishings while providing a more detailed social and economic background essay that places these elegant residences in historical context.<br>This is Victorian America as it has never been presented before - over fifty splendid historic houses that preserve the grandeur of the Gilded Age.</p><p>This survey of America's stately homes is a coffee-table book par excellence. It is divided into three sections: the Agrarian South, the Industrial North, and the Frontier West (everything west of the Hudson River, that is). An introductory text to each section summarizes the political, social, and cultural forces that enabled the building of these opulent mansions. The excellent color photographs include both interior and exterior views, and, of necessity, give only a taste of the treasures to be found in these 53 houses. All the homes are maintained in period style, and many are open to the public. While not a necessary purchase for many libraries, this book will provide readers with a tantalizing glimpse into a way of life that even in its time was experienced by only a few. Recommended for public libraries.<br><i>- Constance Ashmore Fairchild, Univ. of Illinois Lib., Urbana-Champaign</i><br>Copyright 1993 Reed Business Information, Inc.Although the elegant color photographs by Paul Rocheleau--interior and exterior views of where and how the rich and famous lived in the nineteenth-century U.S.--will he admired by readers, the text is also to be commended. Former <i>Antiques</i> magazine editor Garrett has chosen no small task in describing the intellectual, social, historical, and design mindsets of the U.S. in the 1800s. He sets the stage, then, for tracing, via the photos, the hodgepodge of architectural styles existing in the country at that time. More than 50 homes and mansions--some famous (Andrew Jackson's Hermitage, for example), others simply big and costly--are profiled, with accompanying blurbs on furnishings and construction. Most are now public places (addresses are listed in the appendix).

McNeely, Ecology</i></p><h2>Lady Caroline Lamb: A Biography</h2><p>Lady Caroline Lamb, among Lord Byron's many lovers, stands out--vilified, portrayed as a self-destructive nymphomaniac--her true story has never been told. Now, Paul Douglass provides the first unbiased treatment of a woman whose passions and independence were incompatible with the age in which she lived. Taking into account a traumatic childhood, Douglass explores Lamb's so-called "erotomania" and tendency towards drug abuse and madness--problems she and Byron had in common. In this portrait, she emerges as a person who sacrificed much for the welfare of a sick child, and became an artist in her own right. Douglass illuminates her novels and poetry, her literary friendships, and the lifelong support of her husband and her publisher, John Murray.<br></p><p>"...a sympathetic though unsentimental account...Douglass provides a richly textured account of 19th-century aristocratic life, with all its sordid liaisons and backstabbing."--<i>Publishers Weekly</i><br><br>"A monumental work of scholarship that illuminates, in a score of fascinating and unexpected ways, that famous woman 'of wild originality.'"--Simon Winchester, author of <i>The Professor and the Madman</i><br><br>"An exemplary blend of scholarship and sympathy, <i>Lady Caroline Lamb </i>gives us a vivid portrait of the life and times of a scatty, outrageous, self-destructive, and appealing woman, who out-emoted any heroine of Regency Romance, and actually snagged Byron. One reads the fascinating story with a growing conviction that the British aristocracy was almost entirely mad."--Ursula K. Le Guin, novelist. Her most recent books are <i>The Wave in the Mind </i>and <i>Gifts</i><br><br>"As Paul Douglass shows, with sympathy, insight, and persuasive thoroughness, Lady Caroline Lamb--rather than her most famous lover Byron--was truly 'mad, bad and dangerous to know.' This biography does full justice not only to Caroline Lamb's intelligence, willfulness, and capacity to outrage her family and friends, but also to her considerable literary gifts and feminist politics."--Anne K. Mellor, Professor of English and Women's Studies, University of California, Los Angeles<br><br>"A fascinating biography that treats the poems and novels of Lady Caroline Lamb with insight and takes her seriously as a woman, an author, and a passionate witness of the foibles of her age."--Jonathan Gross, Associate Professor, DePaul University, editor of Lady Melbourne's letters, and author of <i>Byron: The Erotic Liberal</i><br><br>"<i>Lady Caroline Lamb</i> is a biographical triumph. Paul Douglass shows great sympathy and perceptiveness in his account of a woman hitherto most famous for her liaison with Byron. He persuades us that Lady Caroline played a role in changing the possibilities for women in the nineteenth century. And he brings out, too, the significance of Caroline&#x2019;s own writings. Packed with original information and insight, <i>Lady Caroline Lamb</i> is, throughout, a pleasure to read."--Michael O&#x2019;Neill, Professor of English, University of Durham<br><br>"With the publication of Paul Douglass's biography, Lady Caroline Lamb has received what her life deserves: a thoughtful, scholarly, sympathetic yet penetrating account that neither reduces her to an unusually vocal and highborn bit player in the Byronic drama nor contorts her to an ideological exemplum of how women and their talents were repressed in Regency England. The result is a beautifully researched, clear, fair, and engrossing biography that permits a remarkable and complicated real woman, and her considerable talents, to emerge from the myths that have long veiled them."--Peter W. Graham, Clifford Cutchins Professor of English, Virginia Tech<br><br>"Before Paul Douglass's immaculately researched, sympathetic, page-turning portrait of Lady Caroline Lamb, it had been her fate to be as maligned by her biographers as she was by her own friends and family. Lady Caroline emerges afresh from these pages as a woman funnier, cleverer, braver, more gifted and more tragic than we previously had cause to believe, and while her frantic affair with Byron remains the central moment of her life we can no longer say that it was the defining one. But Douglass does not tell the story of just one woman; so close was Lady Caroline Lamb to the political and cultural heart of the Regency that, in exploring so intelligently the causes and effects of her exhausting life, he gives us a new portrait of the age."--Frances Wilson, author of <i>Literary Seductions: Compulsive Writers and Diverted Readers</i> and T<i>he Courtesan's Revenge: Harriette Wilson, the Woman who Blackmailed the King</i><br><br>"Oh the low life of the high born! Paul Douglas's spirited account of Lady Caroline's love affairs, intrigues, ambitions, and accomplishments is compulsively readable.

During 20 years spent working in a remote part of eastern Finland, L�nnrot collected fragments of folk tales and poetry which he believed formed a continuous epic. He undertook 11 field trips on a quest to gather as much material as he could, partly funded by the Finnish Literary Society, of which he was a founding member. The result was the <i>Kalevala</i>, first published in 1835. L�nnrot continued to collect material, eventually bringing out the version we know today in 1849. It consists of 22,795 verses, divided into 50 songs. L�nnrot became a professor of Finnish language and literature at the University of Helsinki in 1853. His work paved the way for the development of modern Finnish literature and promoted Finnish as the national language over Swedish. From 1866 he worked on the 14-year-long task of compiling the first Finnish&#x2013;Swedish dictionary which contained over 200,000 entries. <b>Horatio Clare</b> is the author of <i>Running for the Hills</i>.</p><br></p><h2>Computer Organization and Embedded Systems</h2><p>The sixth edition of this book covers the key topics in computer organization and embedded systems.

Alan Fraser has combined his extensive concert and pedagogical experience, his long-standing collaboration with the virtuoso Kemal Gekich, and his professional training in Feldenkrais Method to create this innovative technique. Using numerous musical examples and sketches he shows how many common movement habits at the keyboard can be counterproductive, and provides a new way of manipulating the skeletal frame of the hand to produce astonishing sonic results from the instrument.<br><br>This book suggests that in the light of new insights into the physics of human movement, a further development of piano technique is now possible, and that improved physical ability can free musical individuality to express itself more fully. The series of movement exercises presented activates the physical functions necessary to the pianist, helping both students who need remedial work in basic strength at the keyboard, and those who seek a new dimension of musical understanding and a new path for the development of pianist skills - thus synthesizing musical and physical issues. This approach can also serve as an effective antidote to debilitating performance anxiety, increasing one's emotional security by improving the physical and musical basis for it. By filling in a missing link between intention and physical execution, this book truly aims to advance the "craft of piano playing."<br><br><b>Visit Alan Fraser's web site at http://alanfraser.faithweb.com/</b></p><p>Canadian pianist Alan Fraser presents master classes and recitals worldwide.
